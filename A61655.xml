            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> may believe it is no pleaſure to me to complain of the Immorality of a degenerate age: and the vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts which prevailing vice like a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Tyrant hath of late years made, I ſay, not over the Religion, but the very reaſon of Humane Nature, and the Dependencies thereof. Which as it is not to be mentioned by good men without lamentation, ſo cannot be diſſembled or excuſed without participation. Prophane ſwearing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean whoredom, and beaſtly Drunkenneſs, with other too manifeſt, are not only abounding, but as the Prophet ſpeaketh <hi>mighty ſins</hi> amongſt us; ſtrengthned as well by the quality, as the number of the guilty. It is a prodigious mode of eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for men to value themſelves, or be valued by others according to the meaſure of their intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exceſs. <hi>Etiam viri fortis accipit nomen, qui tamen tanto nequior, quanto ſub poculo invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctior.</hi> They are the mighty who can drink moſt wine, and the men of ſtrength who can mingle ſtrong Drink, as if they envyed that Royal Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Name, and were ambitious of the Honour
<pb facs="tcp:105608:3"/>of his Inſcription upon his Tomb, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>I have been able to drink abundantly, and to bear it ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> In the pride of which ſtrength ſome will have the confidence to glory, even while a paralytick trembling, (no weak evidence of their great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements in their <hi>Bacchanalia</hi>) hath diſabled their hands to ſerve their mouth, and monſtrous ſwellings have miſhaped their Bodies into ſuch unweldie burdens that ſome are tempted to ask, <hi>Homines hi an utres verius aeſtimandi?</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not rather Barrels, than Bodies of men.</p>
            <p>Fallen Nature, even in Heathens have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome principles of reſtraint from impudence and exceſs of vice. The <hi>Spartanes</hi> thought it an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual preſervative of their Children from intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate drinking to preſent to their view their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Vaſſals (for, <hi>as drunk as a Beggar</hi> hath been the Proverb) that beholding their loathſome vomit, and ridiculous behaviour they might the more abhorr ſuch gratifying of inordinate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which debaſeth the honour of a man into the ſhame of a beaſt. And the very <hi>Turks</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fit of Drunkenneſs, will lie day and night crying, and praying to <hi>Mahomet</hi> for interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But the very Remnants of Conſcience and ſhame ſeem utterly extinct among ſome Chriſtians of this generation. Surely the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were modeſt, when they that were drunk, were drunk in the night: but now St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is too weak to refel the accuſation, for
<pb facs="tcp:105608:3"/>
               <hi>theſe men may be drunk at the third hour of the day.</hi> And ſome do ſo declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not, Drinking and Singing, Roaring and Revelling, Reeling and Staggering in the open Sun, as if they would confute St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and demonſtrate <hi>Rioting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to be no <hi>works of Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, ſuch credit and power hath Debauchery obtained, that it lifts up it ſelf above controul, and is impatient to be touched, and ready to turn again, and rent the wiſeſt reprover. And who ſo is reſolved to poſſeſs his Veſſel in ſobriety, and Honour, doth <hi>tantum non</hi> forfit his reputation, and is in danger to be written among the ſuſpected by thoſe whoſe God is <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whoſe Temple the Tavern, whoſe Altar the Table, whoſe Prieſt the Vintner, whoſe Offering Wine and ſtrong Drink, and whoſe Heaven is ſenſual. Who have arrived to that degree of Atheiſm, as to fortifie their Luſts againſt their Conſcience with the vaineſt flattery, and ſelf deluding conceit, that their great pretences of loyalty and zeal for King and Church ſhall ſanctifie the groſſeſt viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Laws of Morality, both ſacred and civil. Nay, vice will ſcarce acknowledge it ſelf to violate, but even claims a right, and calls it ſelf by the name of Vertue. According to the Moraliſt's Character of the worſt times. <hi>Habebitur ebrietati honor, et plurimum meri cepiſſe victus erit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> Offering ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, of Wine is become an Inſtance of Noble and Generous Entertainment, and a part of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb facs="tcp:105608:4"/>civility to accept it. Gueſts are ſcarce made welcome, if not made Drunk. Such an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging bond is courting, courteſie and complement, ſuch force in great examples, ſuch arguments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed of Honour and Loyalty, Such colour, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſparkling in the glaſs to provoke, that he muſt be a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> or a <hi>Rechabite</hi> that hath the courage to withſtand the power of ſo great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He that will be ſober, is uncivil, and it is an high affront, deſerving no leſs than a ſtab, to boggle at life and Soul-deſtroying Healths, or to refuſe to be drowned for Company. Thus doth the pride of debauchery magnifie it ſelf, Hectoring virtue out of its due honour, and arrogating an unjuſt Glory to its own ſhame.</p>
            <p>What the iſſue of this great evil will be, is the fear of the Good, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt for the Vomit and filth whereof all Tables are full, the Land alſo in juſt retribution ſpue out her Inhabitants. That ſo many Judgments by which Heaven hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a ſinful Nation ſhould not only prove it incorrigible, but leave it declining into worſe, is no weak indication of a deſperate diſeaſe. He that hath denovnced <hi>Wo to the Drunkards,</hi> is faithful to keep and Almighty to execute his word. Whereof he hath in his righteous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence made many ſad and woful Inſtances. As in too many other places ſo particularly in your <hi>Colcheſter.</hi> He hath not left himſelf without witneſs, by a very quick and remarkable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a young Drunkard, twice dead, dying dead drunk. The Report whereof at leaſt came
<pb facs="tcp:105608:4"/>not ſhort of your ſpecial notice. May I have leave to ſpeak it. God ſometimes bleſt your Town with the happy Miniſtry of his laborious and faithful Servant, Mr. <hi>Owen Stockton,</hi> whoſe due Character is elſewhere read, whoſe Head, Heart, Tongue, and Pen conſtantly travelled for the Salvation of precious, yet periſhing Souls. At this warning and amazing ſtroke, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the deſtroying Peſtilence among you, which exerciſed the labour of his Pen to a conſiderable Vo ume, which yet never ſaw the light, His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit like St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s was ſtirred in him, to improve the advantage of ſo ſevere a Providence, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it the Word of God committed to his truſt, hoping that the Sword of the Spirit being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſharpned, might be the more effectual and mighty through God againſt this fleſhly Luſt which warreth againſt the Soul, and hath made more havock of the Sons of men, than ever <hi>Saul</hi> did of the Saints of God. In which honourable and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ingagement with this deadly ſin. He convicts it as the common Enemy of the Bodies and Souls of men, declareth open war againſt it, defieth, and caſteth dirt upon the face of its glory, armeth and incourageth the aſſailing hoſt of Christians to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, diſchargeth againſt it the thundering Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, laden with the vengeance of Almighty ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, purſueth it to its higher Mountains, raiſeth batteries against its ſtrongeſt holds, diſcovereth and defeateth all its ſubtil ſtratagems, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth all its pretences. Having performed his work according to his great ability, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:105608:5"/>his zealous Soul to a particular Congregation <hi>viva voce,</hi> he deſigned with ſome enlargement for general uſe to commit it to the Preſs, But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had put to it <hi>ultimam manum,</hi> God put to his Life <hi>ultimam lineam.</hi> Which Providence I am not prone to interpret, as a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaying to him, <hi>let the Drunkard alone, thou ſhalt be dumb, and ſhalt not be a reproov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill,</hi> but will rather hope, God ſo ordered that it ſhould be his dying Pen, that it might be the more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Such as he left it, worthy of the Preſs beyond my commendation, is here Publiſhed, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſented <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to your hands. I am aware how much I preſume thus to approach you, for which I am concerned to make my Apology. I am not ignorant what Honourable Reſpects the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> deſervedly had for your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and what reciprocal Reſpects obliged him thereunto: which I am bound to believe he would gladly have expreſſed, and acknowledged by ſome more publick Teſtimony. Be pleaſed then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and accept this as a poſthumous offering, which a leſſer hand, though not with leſs Reſpects, humbly maketh to you as in his Name.</p>
            <p>The Relation, affection and compaſſion which he had towards <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and the Souls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alwayes excited the vehemency of his deſires, ſharpened the edge of his juſt actions, directed the aim of his endeavours, and intended the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Prayers on its behalf, that ſome happy
<pb facs="tcp:105608:5"/>fruit of the travail of his Soul, and particularly of this, might there be found. In complyance wherewith, conſidering the Character you bear in your Town, I have preſumed to prefix your worthy Names to this ſmall Volume, which being an Orphan doth more earneſtly crave your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and is ambitious of the favour and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your recommendation to the concerned Reader.</p>
            <p>The dreadful providence towards the young man, who was made an open ſpectacle of God's Righteous Judgment, (the occaſion of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheets) ſpeaking more eſpecially to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> becauſe in it, did naturally prompt me to betake my ſelf to the advantage of ſome more <hi>eminent names</hi> among you, through which to revive the memory of ſo loud a warning, if happily, ſome at leaſt who have been long inſtances of Patience, might with the greater intention <hi>legere exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum juſtitiae ne fiant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not forbear to add, that by <hi>Royal</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and truſt, you fill honourable ſeats of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, extended to a large Province in the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Now ſuch is the pride and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the obſtinacy and contradiction of the ſin complained of, ſo strengthned by corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and temptation without, that the beſt inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſtry cannot prevail againſt it, but is forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confeſs the weakneſs of its moſt powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and paſſionate perſwaſions, and therefore cryeth to you, as the woman in Holy Writ, in another caſe, <hi>help O Magiſtrate,</hi> ye alſo are the
<pb facs="tcp:105608:6"/>Miniſters of God, into whoſe hands God hath put the Sword of Juſtice, not to be born in vain. Your own great examples of Sobriety ſhall ſtrengthen your hands in exerting your juſt Authority, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the intemperance of licentious appetites. Wherein you are beyond doubt aſſured, there is no colour of diſloyalty to Prince, no Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Church, no violation of Oaths, no breach of Truſt, none to be offended but the guilty, who ought not to be pleaſed.

               <p>THE occaſion of my handling this Text is a ſad and dreadfull Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which lately befell a young man, who for ſome years was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hopefull for Religion, a diligent attender upon God's Ordinances, and well eſteemed of among the people of God, but afterwards being led away with temptation, he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time overtaken with the ſin of drunkenneſs, and it ſeemed good to the Holy and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God to cut him off in the act of ſin, when he was (as is generally reported) ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſtrong drink that he was not able to go, but was led, and laid upon a bed, and dyed in few hours, without coming to himſelf again. When a Malefactour is puniſhed by men, all that hear thereof ſhould fear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like ſins. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.11. <hi>And all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105608:8"/>ſhall hear and fear, and ſhall do no more any ſuch wickedneſs as this is among you.</hi> This is ſpoken of ſtoneing to death a perſon, that ſhould entice another to go and ſerve other Gods. God expected that the hearing of ſuch a mans death ſhould make all <hi>Iſrael</hi> fear, and do no more any ſuch wickedneſs. When a ſinner is cut off by the immediate hand of God, his death is as much or more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, than when he dyeth by the hands of men, and therefore I may ſay of this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that befell this young man, Oh that all <hi>Colcheſter</hi> would hear, and oh that all <hi>England</hi> might hear and fear, and do no more any ſuch wickedneſs as this is, to drink Wine or ſtrong drink till they be drunk. I do the rather take this occaſion to preach againſt this ſin of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, becauſe this young man, on whom God ſent this judgment was one, that uſed to attend on my Miniſtry, and I thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to warn others, yea to warn all my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to take heed and beware of this ſin of drunkenneſs.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, I have no need to be warned to take heed of the ſin of drunkenneſs, I hate and abhor it, and look upon it as a moſt beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin, what manner of perſons do you take us to be, that you warn us to take heed of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs.</p>
               <p>A. 1. They do not know the corruption of their own hearts, nor what ſtrength and power there is in a temptation, that think they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105608:8"/>have no need to be warned to take heed of drunkenneſs. There is in our corrupt natures an inclination to all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Sin, taking occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> And it is from God's reſtraining us, that thoſe evil inclinations, that are in our hearts, do not break forth in our lives. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I with-held thee from ſinning againſt me, therefore ſuffered I thee not to touch her.</hi> By the power of temptation we may be drawn to thoſe ſins, which we think our ſelves moſt averſe unto, yea to which we apprehend that we have ſuch an averſeneſs, that we will rather ſuffer death than conſent to them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.35. <hi>Peter ſaid unto him, though I ſhould dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</hi> Though <hi>Peter</hi> thought and ſaid this, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye than deny Chriſt, yet being in a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he did three times fall into that ſin, which he thought he of all men ſhould never have yielded to; <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet I will never be offended.</hi> And which he thought he ſhould rather dye than commit, he fell thrice into in one night, in the ſame night in which he ſolemnly profeſſed, he would rather dye than deny the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Hazael</hi> ſeemed to ſcorn the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, when he told him how cruelly he would deal with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he would kill their young men with the ſword, and daſh out their childrens brains, and rip up the women with child, and replyed, 2 <hi>King.</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105608:9"/>8.13. <hi>But what is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this great thing;</hi> Yet he fullfilled what the Prophet had foretold.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaw it needfull to warn his own Diſciples, who had left all to follow him, to take heed of this ſin of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>And take heed to your ſelves leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.</hi> That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks here to his own Diſciples is evident from <hi>Ch.</hi> 20.45. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.5, 7. Compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.1, 3. <hi>Matthew</hi> relating much of the ſame diſcourſe, tells that it was a private diſcourſe between Chriſt and his Diſciples. And ſeveral paſſages in the Chapter ſhew plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was ſpoken to the Diſciples; As <hi>ver.</hi> 12.15, 17, 28. <hi>They ſhall lay their hands on you, and perſecute you— and ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake.</hi> &amp;c. Now if our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaw it needfull to warn his own Diſciples, who were enabled to ſuffer perſecution for Righteouſneſs ſake, to take heed of drunkenneſs, why ſhould any of us think we have no need to be warned to take heed of this ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Perſons of great eminency for the grace of God have been overtaken with this ſin of drunkenneſs, and that in a very ſhamefull manner. <hi>Noah</hi> was a man of great eminency in the grace of God: he kept his integrity
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105608:9"/>when all the men on the earth had corrupted their ways, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9, 11, 12. He was a <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. He was renowned for his faith, and fear of God, and was an heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by ſaith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. He was a man in great favour with God, and could do great things with God in Prayer, and is ranked with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> God's ſpecial favourites. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.16, 18, 20. Yet this <hi>Noah</hi> who was ſo eminent and famous in his Generation, was overcome with Wine in a moſt ſhamefull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in ſo much as he lay uncovered in his Tent, and his Son ſaw his nakedneſs, and this after he had ſeen Gods judgment in drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old World for their ſins, and his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy in ſparing him and his Family. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.20, 21, 22. <hi>And Noah planted a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and he drunk of the Wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his Tent, and Ham ſaw the nakedneſs of his Father, and told it his two brethren without. Lot</hi> was a Righteous man, ſo eminent for Holineſs that he was vexed in his Soul to ſee the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. He was in ſuch favour with God, that the Lord ſent two Angels to his houſe to give him warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and to bid him haſten out of that place, leſt he was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.1, 12, 13, 15. He was in ſuch favour with God, that though <hi>Sodom</hi>'s ſins were exceeding great, and Angels were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105608:10"/>come down from Heaven to deſtroy that place, yet they could do nothing, towards deſtroying that City, till <hi>Lot</hi> was gone out of it, and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to <hi>Zoar, ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Haſt thee, eſcape thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for I cannot do any thing till thou art come thither.</hi> He had ſuch power with God that he prevailed for the ſparing of a whole City, which had deſerved deſtruction, as well as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> for the Cities about <hi>Sodom</hi> were <hi>given to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh as well as Sodom. Jude</hi> 7. Yet at <hi>Lot's</hi> requeſt the City of <hi>Zoar</hi> was ſpared. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.21. <hi>See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing, that I will not overthrow this City, for the which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> Yet this Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was twice overcome with wine, and that to ſuch an high degree as that he knew not what he did, and in his drunkenneſs committed the heinous ſin of inceſt with both his Daughters, for his two Daughters were with Child by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Father, when they had made him drunk. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.30. to the 36. And <hi>Lot's</hi> ſin was the greater becauſe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after he had ſeen God's terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the adjacent Cities for their ſins, and after God had ſhewen a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of mercy tovvards him in his deliverance out of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Novv if ſuch eminent Saints as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> vvere overtaken vvith the ſin of drunkenneſs, and that in a very dreadfull manner, vvho can ſay they have no need of being vvarned to take heed of this ſin? Let
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105608:10"/>theſe examples have this effect upon us, to make ſuch as think they ſtand, take heed leaſt they fall. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.</p>

               </list>
               <p>What is meant by the Crown of Pride?</p>
               <p>A. 1. By the Prophets crying wo to the Crown of Pride, we may underſtand that Pride is odious to God in all ſorts of perſons, though they be Kings and Princes, ſuch as wear Crowns, if great men; If the greateſt Kings be lifted up with Pride they are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was the greateſt Monarch in the World; <hi>All People, Nations and Languages trembled and feared before him, whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he ſaved alive. Dan.</hi> 5.19. Yet when this great
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105608:11"/>King was lifted up with Pride, God did no ſpare him, but depoſed him from his Kingly Throne, and made him lower than the loweſt of men: For he was driven from among men, and had his dwelling among the beaſts, and did eat graſs as the Oxen. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.20. <hi>But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Pride, he was depoſed from his Kingly Throne. Dan.</hi> 4.31, 32. <hi>O King Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar the Kingdom is departed from thee, and they ſhall drive thee from men, and thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhall be with the beaſts of the field, they ſhall make thee to eat graſs as Oxen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By wo to the Crown of Pride, we may underſtand, wo to thoſe in whom Pride is a reigning ſin. Crowns are worn by thoſe that reign, in token of their regal dignity. We muſt not ſuffer Pride or any other ſin to reign in us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal body, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> Good men may be overtaken with Pride as well as other ſins, but it doth not reign over them, but they reſiſt and oppoſe it, and humble themſelves for it, as we may ſee in the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25, 26.— <hi>His heart was lifted up — Notwithſtanding He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah humbled himſelf for the Pride of his heart.</hi> Now the wo denounced againſt Pride, is againſt the Crown of Pride, that is, where Pride is a reigning ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the Crown of pride may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood thoſe Crowns or Garlands made of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105608:11"/>or other Flowers, which drunkards uſe to wear at their drunken meetings. <hi>Ebrii ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant ſibi coronas imponere;</hi> As <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It was an Heatheniſh cuſtom for drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards to put Crowns on their heads, which cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was imitated by many of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> againſt ſuch as theſe the Prophet denounceth Gods judgments, wo to the Crown of pride, to the drunkards of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, wo to thoſe drunkards in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that take a pride in drunkenneſs, that glory in their ſhame, that ſtrive to excell and get the maſtery of each of other in drunkenneſs.</p>
               <p>What is meant by the Drunkards of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. A drunkard is one that is given, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, accuſtomed to the ſin of drunkenneſs, one that is frequently drunk, <hi>Noah</hi> was once overtaken with drunkenneſs, but he was no drunkard, he was not addicted and accuſtomed to this ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ephraim</hi> was a Tribe in <hi>Iſrael. Numb.</hi> 1.33. <hi>Of the Tribe of Ephraim were</hi> 40500. Sometimes by <hi>Ephraim</hi> is underſtood the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which revolted from the houſe of <hi>David</hi> in the days of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.2. <hi>It was told the houſe of David, Syria is confederate with Ephraim,</hi> that is, with the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> vvhich vvere called by the name of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jeroboam</hi> vvho vvas the firſt King that the ten Tribes ſet up, after their defection from the houſe of <hi>David</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105608:12"/>vvas of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.26, 31. And alſo becauſe <hi>Ephraim</hi> vvas the chiefeſt of the ten Tribes: ſo that vvo to the drunkards of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is as much as vvo to the drunkards in <hi>Iſrael. Iſrael</hi> vvas a people that had God's Word and Prophets, a people for vvhom God had done greater things than for any Nation under Heaven. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>Iſrael</hi> profeſſed themſelves to be the people of the Lord; And therefore to be a drunkard in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was far worſe than to be a drunkard in <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Moab,</hi> or any other Heatheniſh Land.</p>
               <p>What is meant by that wo which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet denounceth againſt the Crovvn of pride, and the drunkards of <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It implyes that pride and drunkenneſs are vvofull ſins, and that all proud perſons, and all drunkards are in a vvofull condition. This little vvord <hi>wo,</hi> is a comprehenſive vvord, it comprehends all ſorts of miſeries, both in this Life and the Life to come. VVhen the Scripture ſaith vvo to drunkards, it implyes that the curſe of God is upon them in this Life, and vvill vvithout Repentance remain upon them to Eternity. But ſee more particularly what is included in the wo denounced in the Scripture.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The wo denounced in Scripture imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all ſorts of miſery and calamity on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, even to our utter ruine and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.29. <hi>Wo to thee Moab, thou art undone.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105608:12"/>
                  <item>2. The wo denounced in Scripture imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Spiritual judgments, that God will ſend his plagues on thoſe mens ſouls, to whom his word ſaith wo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Wo unto their Soul, for they have rewarded evil againſt themſelves.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. When the Scripture denounceth wo againſt ſinners, this wo includeth in it the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unavoidable damnation of Hell. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.28, 33. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Hypocrites — How can ye eſcape the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell.</hi> So that this wo comprehends all ſorts of judgments, internal, external, and eternal judgments.</item>

               <p>The text being explained, I ſhall not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent treat of the wo denounced againſt the ſin of pride, though that be an abominable ſin, but of the wo denounced againſt the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which concerneth all other drunkards as well as thoſe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> though more eſpecially ſuch drunkards as live under the means of grace, and are profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion.

                  <p>VVo to the drunkards of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> It is not to be underſtood excluſive, as if other drunkards were not in a wofull condition, as well as thoſe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but eminenter, the drunkards of <hi>Ephraim</hi> above others were in a wofull condition, becauſe they ſinned againſt more light and more means of grace than the drunkards in Heatheniſh Countries. Before I ſhew what a wofull ſin drunkenneſs is, it will be expedient to enquire what drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is.</p>
                  <p>Drunkenneſs is ſometimes taken figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as when it is applyed to ſin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2, 6. or affliction; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.21. Or properly for being drunk with wine or other ſtrong drink. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine.</hi> And in this ſenſe I ſhall handle it in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Drunkenneſs is a vice ſo well known that there is little need of any definition to be given of it, yet for a fuller opening of the nature of this ſin, I ſhall give this deſcription of it.</p>
                  <p>Drunkenneſs is a ſin whereby a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to exceſs in drinking, to the depriving of himſelf of the uſe of his reaſon. For the explaining of this deſcription of drunkenneſs,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105608:13"/>there are three things to be conſidered in the ſin of drunkenneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The inordinate love and deſire of wine or other ſtrong drink. This is ſinfull when the heart is inordinately enclined to the love and deſire of wine or ſtrong drink. It is noted as a vice in the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they loved flagons of wine. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>The children of Iſrael who look to other Gods, and love flagons of wine.</hi> It is mentioned as a requiſite in the Miniſter of the Goſpel, that he muſt be one <hi>not given to wines.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. His heart, his affections muſt not run after wine. As the going out of the heart after Idols is ſinfull, as well as the bowing the body to Idols. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Their heart goeth after their Idols.</hi> So the going out of the heart to wine or ſtrong drink in an inordinate manner is ſinfull as well as exceſſive drinking; For inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to things, in themſelves lawfull, become ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

               <p>VVe have ſeen what the ſin of drunkenneſs is, now I ſhall prove by ſeveral arguments that drunkenneſs is a great, a dangerous, a wofull ſin, whereby it will appear that all drunkards are in a wofull condition.</p>
               <p>§. Drunkenneſs is expreſly againſt the command of God.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Drunkenneſs is plainly and expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in Gods word. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine. Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leaſt at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs— Rom.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs</hi> — The drunkard can't plead ignorance that he did not know drunkenneſs to be a ſin.

Sins of ignorance are as it were no ſins compared with ſins againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

Drunkards and other ſinners that know God's will, and will not do it, contemn and deſpiſe God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?</hi> Drunkards are guilty of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, for ſinning againſt the light of Gods word is accounted rebellion; <hi>Job.</hi> 24.13. <hi>They are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light.</hi> And that is an heinous ſin to be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and rebellious againſt the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of witch-craft, and ſtubborneſs is as iniquity and idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. <hi>It is a beaſtly ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Drunkenneſs is a beaſtly ſin, it deprives a man of his reaſon, and makes him carry himſelf like a beaſt. It is a vile thing for a man to degrade and make himſelf like a beaſt. <hi>Job.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105608:16"/>and reputed as vile in your ſight.

The Aſs is a ſilly beaſt, yet the Aſſes will not drink to exceſs, they drink no more than will quench their thirſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.11. <hi>The wild Aſſes quench their thirſt.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends the ſluggard to the Ant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her ways and be wiſe.</hi> So may I ſend the drunkard to the wild Aſſes, go to the wild Aſſes thou drunkard, and conſider their ways and be wiſe, who having no guide, over-ſeer or ruler, never drink any more than will quench their thirſt, though they meet with the beſt and pleaſanteſt Springs, and pureſt Fountains under Heaven; And wilt thou who haſt had many inſtructors, that have taught thee the odiouſneſs of this ſin of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs; be enticed by the pureneſs of the wine, or the pleaſantneſs of thy drink, to drink to exceſs?

               <p n="3">III. Drunkenneſs is a moſt miſchievous ſin, and brings a world of miſchief along with it both to ſoul and body, and eſtate, and good name.</p>

Drunkards have no love to God, no delight in God, no deſire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, no fear of God, no heart to that which is good. Drunkenneſs is a fleſhly luſt, and fleſhly luſts war againſt, and tend

Drunkenneſs appears to be a great ſin, becauſe oft times it is puniſhed with ſudden death, and ſometimes drunkards are cut off in the very act of ſin; They are very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off, ſuddenly and unexpectedly. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.10. <hi>While they are drunken as drunkards, they ſhall be devoured as ſtubble fully dry.</hi> Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that is fully dry is conſumed in a moment, ſo are many drunkards cut off ſuddenly, when they have no thoughts, no expectations of death. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.45, 46. <hi>If that ſervant ſhall begin to eat and drink, and to be drunken. The Lord of that Servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</hi> We ſee here the wofull condition of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105608:22"/>both in their death and after their death. Their death is oft times ſudden and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have not a day, not an hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Their Lord comes in a day that they did not look for him, and in an hour that they were not aware of, and ſhall cut them in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is, ſeperate their ſouls from their bodies by death, and after death give them their portion with unbelievers, that is, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. Drunkards are oſt times cut off in the very act of ſin, which is a dreadfull token of Gods diſpleaſure, when he will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe a ſinner ſpace for Repentance, but cuts him off in the very act of ſin. <hi>Elah</hi> a King, a King in <hi>iſrael,</hi> was cut off in the very act of ſin, while he was drinking himſelf drunk in his Stewards houſe. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>His ſervant Zimri conſpired againſt him as he was in Tirzah, drinking himſelf drunk in the houſe of Arza, Steward of his houſe in Tirzah; And Zimri went in, and ſmote him, and killed him.</hi> This is recorded to the terrors of all drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards in all Ages, to the end of the World. As Chriſt ſaid to deterr us from looking back, <hi>remember Lots wife:</hi> So may I ſay to deter you from drunkenneſs; Remember <hi>Elah,</hi> who was killed whilſt he was drinking himſelf drunk; And if God did not ſpare a King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> take heed leaſt he do not ſpare you.

               <p n="7">VII. Drunkenneſs makes a man unfit for any good work, unfit for the ſervice of God and Men, unfit for Death and Judgment; It makes a man unfit for Prayer, and all other Religious Duties. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore ſober, and watch unto Prayer.</hi> No men are fit for Prayer but ſober men; It is probable <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> had diſtempered themſelves with wine or ſtrong drink, when they preſumed to offer up ſtrange fire, and fire went out from the Lord, and devoured them, for immediately
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105608:23"/>after the relation of their ſin and puniſhment, there is a ſtrict charge given to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, that they ſhould not drink wine or ſtrong drink when they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation upon pain of death, that they might be fit for their employment. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10, 11. It alſo unfits a man for the ſervice of his Generation, eſpecially for a place of publick truſt. Many Armies have been ruined, Towns and Kingdoms loſt by the drunkenneſs of the Commanders. A ſmall Army of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> not exceeding 7000, ſetting upon the <hi>Syrians,</hi> when <hi>Benhadad</hi> their King was drinking himſelf drunk with his Confederates, put the <hi>Syrians</hi> to flight, and ſlew them with a great ſlaughter, although beſides his own great army, he had Thirty and Two Kings that came to his aſſiſtance. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.16, 17, 20.

Be not deceived, Neither Fornicators—nor Drunkards— ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> If a man be a drunkard, and think to go to Heaven when he dyeth, he deceiveth his own Soul. Drunkenneſs is a manifeſt work of the fleſh, and the Scripture tells us plainly, that they that live in drunkenneſs and ſuch like ſins ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe; Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs— Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like, of which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Drunkards may know their doom before they come to the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, <hi>I tell you before</hi>— that is, before the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come, before the ſentence be paſt upon you, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. The Apoſtle knew drunkards were dull of hearing, and ſlow of heart to believe, and therefore he tells them over and over, that they ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God; and what folly and madneſs is this to part with a Kingdom, an Everlaſting Kingdom, the Kingdom of Heaven for a pot of drink, or a cup of wine. It was a fooliſh act in <hi>Eſau,</hi> and argued him to be a prophane man; to ſell his Birth-right
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105608:24"/>for a morſel of meat. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Leaſt there be any fornicator or prophane perſon, as Eſau, who for one morſel of meat ſold his birth-right.</hi> Drunkards are guilty of worſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs than <hi>Eſau,</hi> for they part with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſing than a Birth-right, namely with the Kingdom of Heaven, for a pot of drink or a cup of wine, which doth them no good, but much hurt.

               <p>X. Drunkenneſs is an enticing, bewitching ſin, which is very hardly left by thoſe that are addicted to it. Neither the word nor rod of God prevaileth with men to leave this ſin, but they go on ſinning againſt light, ſinning againſt the counſels and reproofs, and tears of friends, againſt the checks of their own Conſciences,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105608:25"/>though the Lord afflict them in their bodies, eſtates, good names, yet ſtill they perſevere in this ſin. Though when upon ſick beds they are under terrors of Conſcience, and feel as it were ſome flaſhes of Hell Fire, and make great vows, and ſolemn proteſtations, that if God will ſpare their lives, and raiſe them up again, they will leave off their drunkenneſs, yet when they are reſtored to health, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their old courſes again. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.35. <hi>They have ſtricken me, ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſick, they have beaten me, and I felt it not; VVhen ſhall I awake? I will ſeek it yet again. Solomon</hi> ſpeaks here of drunkards who are not diſheartned by all the difficulties, and troubles, and blows that they meet with in following after ſtrong drink, but reſolve to ſeek yet again, and to perſiſt in their diſſolute courſes. Drunkards are wont to encourage themſelves, and one another to perſiſt in their drunken courſes, under all diſcouragements. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.12. <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more aboundant.</hi> In ſtead of deſiſting, they grow more reſolved in their way; And the reaſon why this ſin is hardly left, and ſo few recovered from it, may be partly from the ſtrength this ſinfull habit gets in the ſoul, by the many repeated acts of this ſin, and alſo from the pleaſingneſs of this ſin to corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the more pleaſing any ſin is, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105608:25"/>more hardly it is left, and chiefly from the juſt and righteous judgment of God, who giveth up men, who go on ſinning againſt light, unto their own hearts luſts, ſaying to them, he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill. Drunkenneſs is called by ſome, <hi>vitium maximae adhaerentiae,</hi> a ſin that ſticks cloſer and faſter to a man than any other ſin.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Drunkenneſs is a worſe ſin in a Miniſter of the Goſpel, who ſhould be a pattern as well as a preacher of Righteouſneſs, than in any other man. Under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law the Prieſts were forbidden to drink wine or ſtrong drink upon pain of death, when they were to go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Aaron, ſaying, do not drink wine nor ſtrong drink, thou, nor thy Sons which thee, when ye go into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, leaſt ye dye, it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105608:28"/>ſhall be a ſtatute for ever, throughout your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</hi> And the reaſon of this ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of wine and ſtrong drink to the Prieſts when they were to attend the ſervice of the Lord, is added. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.11. <hi>And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between clean and unclean, and that ye may teach the children of Iſrael all the Statutes which the Lord hath ſpoken to them, by the hand of Moſes.</hi> The prohibition of the Prieſts drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine when they were to attend the ſervice of the Lord, is renewed by <hi>Ezekiel. Ezek.</hi> 44.21. <hi>Neither ſhall any Prieſt drink wine when they enter into the Inner Court.</hi> And as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law there was a ſtrict charge given to the Prieſts, not to drink wine or ſtrong drink when they were to be employed in ſerving the Lord, and teaching the people, ſo it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all Miniſters under the Goſpel, that they be ſober, and not given to wine. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>A Biſhop muſt be blameleſs — vigilant, ſober— not given to wine. Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>For a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop must be blameleſs as the Steward of God,—not given to wine</hi>— What the Apoſtle ſaith in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> concerning the qualifications of a Biſhop, concerneth all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, which are called to preach God's Holy word, and take the care and overſight of mens ſouls, and it is twice mentioned concerning them, that they muſt not be given to wine. The uſe of wine is not wholly forbidden to the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105608:28"/>for ſuch as have weak ſtomachs may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make uſe of this good creature of God, but then it muſt be with very much moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangeliſt was allowed by the Apoſtle the uſe of wine, but it was in a ſmall meaſure, and ſparingly, ſo far as his weak ſtomach had need of it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Drink no longer water, but uſe a little wine for thy stomach's ſake, and thine often infirmities.</hi> That drunkenneſs and other ſcandalous ſins, are far worſe in Miniſters of the Goſpel, than in any other men, will appear ſeveral ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Miniſters of the Goſpel are under great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligations to Holyneſs than other men. They are to be the light of the World, and the ſalt of Earth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>Ye are the ſalt of the earth— ye are the light of the world.</hi> They are Chriſts Ambaſſadors. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20: And Gods Stewards. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. And what a diſhonour is it to God to have a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Steward, a drunken Ambaſſadour! They are ſtiled Angels; <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. And what an uncomely ſight is it to ſee one whoſe office and dignity reſembles him to an Angel, by his drunken and ſottiſh practices to make himſelf like a beaſt. Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to be examples and patterns of Holyneſs to ſuch as believe in Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 12. <hi>Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Tit.</hi> 2.7. <hi>In all things ſhewing thy ſelf a pattern of good works.</hi> And for a man that is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105608:29"/>to be an example of holineſs to believers to be given to drunkenneſs, which civil men, which ſober Heathens deteſt, and which makes a man worſe than a beaſt is a moſt abominable ſin.</item>
                  <item>2. The evil example of Miniſters of the Goſpel will draw multitudes to that which is evil. If Miniſters frequent Taverns, and drink to exceſs, their example will encourage and embolden their neighbours to follow wine and ſtrong drink, a prophane Miniſter makes a prophane people. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.15. <hi>From the Prophets of Jeruſalem is prophaneneſs gone forth into all the Land.</hi> See alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 10.11. <hi>The Land is full of adulterers— For both the Prophet and the Prieſt are prophane.</hi> When thoſe that are teachers of others depart from the ways of God, their example makes many to ſtumble. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge— But ye have departed out of the way, ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the law.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The ſame Sacrifice under the Law was required for the ſin of the Prieſt, which was required for the ſin of the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; As we may ſee, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.3, 13.14. When the Prieſt ſinned he was to bring a young Bullock for a ſin offering, and this was the ſame offering which was appointed for the ſin of the whole Congregation. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.14. Whereas for the ſin of the Ruler, there was but a kid of the goats, a male without blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. <hi>ver.</hi> 22.23. And for the ſin of any of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105608:29"/>the common people a kid of the goats, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male without blemiſh, which is of leſs value than the male. <hi>ver.</hi> 27.28. From this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Sacrifices, there being leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the common people, than for the Ruler, and leſs for the Ruler than for the Prieſt, we may learn that the ſins of Rulers are greater than the ſins of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſins of Miniſters are greater than the ſins of Rulers, and greater than the ſins of the common people, they may be counted equal of the ſins of a whole Congregation.</item>
                  <item>4. When ſuch as are preachers of God's word, are drunkards, or given to any other ſcandalous ſins, they bring themſelves, and their office, and the worſhip and ſervice of God into contempt among the people. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.27, 28. <hi>Thy teachers have tranſgreſſed againſt me, therefore I have prophaned the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curſe, and Iſrael to reproaches.</hi> When Miniſters of Gods word do not keep Gods ways, the Lord makes them baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible among the people. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Therefore have I made you contemptible and baſe before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways.</hi> This is ſpoken of the Prieſts, as we may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.7, 8. When they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vicious they brought their perſons and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice into contempt among the people. It was the Apoſtles care to magnifie his office, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.13. <hi>I magnifie mine office.</hi> and to walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105608:30"/>in all things, that his Miniſtry might not ſuffer any blame. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no offence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed.</hi> Yea they that are prophane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, do not only bring their perſons and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice into contempt, but make the worſhip and ſervice of the Lord to be abhorred, and that is a mighty ſin for Miniſters by their evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, to give occaſion to any men to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the ſervice of the Lord. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore the ſin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. When ſuch as are preachers of God's word, prove drunkards, or live in any other ſcandalous ſins, though they ſhould be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to ſave others, they themſelves ſhall be ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay unto me at that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have caſt out devils, and in thy name done many wonderfull works; And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> And what a ſad condition is this, to caſt devils out of others, and yet we our ſelves to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottomleſs pit, to abide with the devil for ever. It was the Apoſtles care to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in all things, and keep under his body, leaſt while he endeavoured to ſave others ſouls, he ſhould loſe his own. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25, 26, 27. <hi>Everyone that ſtriveth for the maſtery, is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105608:30"/>in all things— I therefore ſo run— I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leaſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould become a caſt-away.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. Drunkenneſs is ſuch an odious ſin in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, that it hath been by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral councells deemed ſcandalous in Miniſters to frequent Taverns, and divers Canons have been at ſeveral councels, made againſt this ſcandalous practiſe of Miniſters being frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Taverns.</item>

               <p n="3">III. Drunkenneſs is worſe in knowing men, and ſuch as make a profeſſion of Religion, than it is in ignorant and prophane perſons. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. <hi>Wo to the Crown of Pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim. Ephraim</hi> was a Tribe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a knowing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Surely this great Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> worſhipped the true God, and profeſſed themſelves to be the people of God, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the means of grace, and therefore a drunkard of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was in a worſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then a drunkard of <hi>Moab</hi> or <hi>Egypt.</hi> A drunken <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was worſe than a drunken Heathen; That it is far worſe for men of knowledge, and eminent for profeſſion of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105608:31"/>Religion, to be addicted to this ſin of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, than ignorant and prophane men, may be made out ſeveral ways. As,
<list>
                     <item>1. When men of knowledge, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Religion, will frequent Taverns, and ſet tipling at Ale-houſes, till they are enflamed with ſtrong drink, their example will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden ignorant and young perſons to do as they do, and may ruin them for ever. What the Apoſtle ſaith of knowing perſons ſitting and eating in the Idols Temple. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>If any man ſee thee, which haſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſit at meat in the Idols Temple, ſhall not the Conſcience of him that is weak, be embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eat thoſe things which are offered to Idols? And through thy knowledge ſhall thy weaker brother periſh, for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> The ſame may I ſay of ſitting at Taverns and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; If any man ſee thee which haſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſit and drink, and tipple at a Tavern or an Ale-houſe, ſhall not he that is weak be emboldned to follow thy example, and through thy knowledge thy weak brother may periſh Eternally. What is ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan, Joſh.</hi> 22.20. <hi>That man periſhed not alone in his iniquity.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of men of knowledge, they periſh not alone in their iniquities, their example draweth multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to ſin and deſtruction with them.</item>
                     <item>2. The miſcarriages of men of knowledge, and profeſſors of Religion, cauſe the name and Goſpel of God to be blaſphemed. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105608:31"/>2.17, 23, 24. <hi>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and reſteſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boast of God, and knoweſt his will— Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, through breaking the Law, diſhonoureſt thou God? For the name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles through you.</hi> When ſuch as are called and accounted the people of God, and know his will, do break God's Laws, this cauſeth God's name to be diſhonoured and blaſphemed. VVhen <hi>David</hi> who had a great name for Religion, fell into ſcandalous ſins, his fall gave great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme his name. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the child alſo that is born unto thee ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> As the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> rejoyced and triumphed when they heard that <hi>Saul</hi> and his mighty men fell in the battel. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon thy high places, now are the mighty fallen; Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Askelon, leaſt the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Philiſtines rejoyce, leaſt the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the uncircumciſed triumph.</hi> So do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men rejoyce and triumph when they hear of any perſons eminent for profeſſion of Religion, that fall into any ſcandalous ſins; As the Heathen ſpoke ſcoffingly of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they went into captivity. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.20. <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of his Land.</hi> So are

                     <item>3. Sins againſt knowledge are far greater than ſins of ignorance. A ſin committed againſt knowledge is ſo great, that a ſin of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is as it were no ſin compared with it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.41. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, if ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin, but now ye ſay we ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.

Heathens that never heard of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as well as other men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. but it is to be underſtood comparatively, their ſin is ſo great being committed againſt knowledge, againſt the light of my Goſpel, that their ſin had been none at all, compared with their ſin, as it is now aggravated by being committed againſt light; Yet ſins of ignorance are of that heinous nature that they are not explated but by the blood of Chriſt; For there were Offerings and Sacrifices for ſins of ignorance under the Law, as we may ſee, <hi>Lev,</hi> 4.2, 3, 13, 14, 22, 23, 27, 28. Which did type
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105608:32"/>out the expiation of our ſins by Chriſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up himſelf a Sacrifice for us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. And it is ſaid expreſly. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>VVithout ſhedding of blood is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And if ſins of ignorance be not expiated but by the blood of Chriſt, and would have procured our being caſt into Hell torments for ever, what heinous ſins, are ſins againſt knowledge, ſeeing ſins of ignorance are as no ſins, compared with ſins againſt light.</item>
                     <item>4. Such as ſin againſt knowledge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a profeſſion of Religion, ſhall have far greater puniſhment in the other VVorld than ignorant perſons. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. <hi>That ſervant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> who were knowing perſons, being given to oppreſſion and other ſins, and covering their ſins with a profeſſion of Religion, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Therefore ye ſhall receive the greater damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And as ſuch as ſin againſt light, and ſin under a profeſſion of Religion, ſhall receive greater damnation in the other World, ſo they oft times are puniſhed ſooner and more ſeverely in this World than other men. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.

John</hi> the Baptiſt was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſon for wiſdom and piety, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt gives this Character of him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not riſen a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than John the Baptiſt.</hi> He was not only high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed among men, but he was great in the ſight of God, and converted many Souls, and he never drunk any wine or ſtrong drink. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>He ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord, and ſhall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, even from his Mothers Womb, and many of the children of Iſrael ſhall he turn to the Lord their God.</hi> And therefore to ſay none but dull ſouls, and ſneaking fellows, and ſuch as affect ſingularity, ſpeak againſt drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, is a reproaching the Prophets and the Apoſtles, and the beſt men that ever lived, yea our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, for they all preached againſt, and abhorred the ſin of drunkenneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſay that all generous Spirited men, and great wits are great drinkers, and that they that are not ſo, are a company of dull
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105608:40"/>ſouls, and pityfull ſneaking fellows, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and condemn the generation of the righteous, as if they were the baſeſt fort of men, whereas they are the excellenteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are upon the face of the earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3. <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not unto thee. but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight. Prov.</hi> 12.20. <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> Thoſe ſober men whom drunkards call pityfull ſneaking fellows, ſhall lift up their heads with joy and boldneſs before Jeſus Chriſt at the day of judgment, when wine bibbers ſhall call to the Rocks and Mountains to fall on them, and to hide them from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though drunkards think themſelves the only wiſe men, and cry up their Companions as the only witty and brave men, yet in truth and reality they are very fools, and there is not one wiſe man amongſt them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.1. <hi>Wine is a mocker, and ſtrong drink is raging, and whoſoever is deceived thereby is not wie.</hi> If <hi>Solomon</hi> be to be believed, who was one of the wiſeſt men that ever lived, yea if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God which ſpake by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who is the Spirit of truth, be worthy to be believed, we muſt aſſent to it as a certain truth, that whoſoever is deceived by wine or ſtrong drink is not a wiſe man. They may be wiſe for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging worldly matters, but they have not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105608:41"/>that wiſdom which cometh from above, which maketh wiſe to Salvation, for that wiſdom teacheth men to be pure and holy. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure</hi>— And therefore impure and filthy drunkards have none of this wiſdom. They are ſo far from being wiſe men, that in truth and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they are very fools, for they part with the glory and pleaſures of Heaven for ever, for a pot of drink, or a cup of wine, and for the enjoyment of the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon, they plunge themſelves into the torments of Hell for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are not the beſt ſort of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are given to drinking and other vices; Debauched Gentlemen are the reproach of the Gentry. The beſt ſort of Gentlemen are pious and virtuous Gentlemen, who hate and abhor vicious courſes, ſuch as walk in the fear of God, and themſelves, and families are patterns of piety and virtue, ſuch as love and ſeek the welfare of their Country, and are rich in good works.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To be a Miniſter of Chriſt is an high and honourable employment, and it is a good thing that people ſhould have honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and eſteem them very highly, for their work and office ſake. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man ſo account

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt not follow the example of any Miniſter, though he ſhould be the beſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the World, farther than he followeth Jeſus Chriſt. Who was a better Miniſter than the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he deſired no man to follow his example, farther than he himſelf followed Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Be ye follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Did you know what a wofull condition drunken Miniſters are in, you would not be in their caſe for the whole World. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> trembled Body and Soul, and was amazed when he conſidered the wofull condition of drunken Miniſters. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.9, 11. <hi>Mine heart within me is broken, becauſe of the Prophets, all my bones do ſhake— For both Prophet and Prieſt are prophane.</hi> Prophane Miniſters are in Gods account as bad as <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Jer.</hi> 23.14. <hi>I have ſeen alſo in the prophets of Jeruſalem an horrible thing, they commit adultery, and walk in lyes, they ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en alſo the hands of evil doers, that none doth return from his wickedneſs, they are all unto me as Sodom;</hi> And we know that the men of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> were ſuch an abomination to the Lord, that he conſumed them with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105608:43"/>from Heaven. Prophane Miniſters are the worſt ſort of men, and therefore in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are compared to the tail. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.14, 15. <hi>The prophet that telleth lyes he is the tail.</hi> There is a moſt bitter cup, as bitter as worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and gall, prepared for drunken and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Miniſters. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.15. When Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ignorant or negligent in their work, or prophane in their lives, their flock lyeth open for a prey to all that have a mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56 9, 10, 11. And the blood of all thoſe ſouls that periſh either by their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, or evil example, will be required at their hands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is no marvel to ſee ſome Miniſters that have great parts, and much learning, given to drunkenneſs and other ſcandalous ſins. For,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) Knowledge without Grace will not make a man an Holy man. The devils have great knowledge, yet they are wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and do very wicked things.</item>
                     <item>(2.) It was ſo under the law, there were many wicked Prieſts, that lived in ſcandalous ſins. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.21. <hi>The paſtors are become bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh. Jer.</hi> 23.11. <hi>Both prophet and prieſt are prophane.</hi> And it is foretold it would be ſo under the Goſpel, that there would be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preachers that would live wickedly. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23, 24.</item>

               <p n="5">5. If the example and practiſe of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miniſters would make drunkenneſs no ſin, or but a very little one, then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105608:43"/>ſins that ever were commited might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and be counted no ſins, or but very ſmall ones, for they that have been teachers of the people have ſometimes been guilty of the greateſt ſins. What greater ſins than Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Murder and Adultery? yet we find many Prieſts under the Law, taxed with the guilt of theſe fins. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.9. <hi>As troops of robbers wait for a man, ſo the company of Prieſts murder by conſent in the way, for they commit lewdneſs. Jer.</hi> 23.14. <hi>I have ſeen in the Prophets of Jeruſalem an horrible thing, they commit adultery, and walk in lyes—</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.5. <hi>He put down all the idolatrous Prieſts.</hi> What greater ſin than Crucifying Chriſt, yet the Prieſts had the principal hand in putting our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to death. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.20. <hi>The chief prieſts and elders perſwaded the people that they ſhould ask Barrabas, and deſtroy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>All the chief prieſts, and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people, took counſell to put Jeſus to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. <hi>The plea of ſuch as think drunkenneſs good fellowſhip, and the way to preſerve love and friendſhip, anſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 3. My Neighbours are generally giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this way, and I eſteem it a piece of good Fellowſhip to go to the Tavern with my Neighbours, and I look upon it as a way to preſerve love and friendſhip, to go now and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105608:44"/>then with my neighbours to the alehouſe, and to drink, and be merry, and when I am among my friends and neighbours, I am overcome before I am aware, but in regard I have good ends in what I do, I hope I may be excuſed.</p>
               <p>A. 1. This is evil, and not good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to keep company with drunkards, and ſuch fellowſhip as is condemned in Scripture, ſuch as we ought to reprove, and not to be partakers with them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>And have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To call drunkenneſs good fellowſhip, is to call evil good, and there is a wo denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt thoſe that call evil good. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wo to them that call evil good, that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs.</hi> It is a ſtrange deluſion, that men ſhould think, that that fellowſhip which undoeth men both Body and Soul, that ruines their Eſtates, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars their Children, hinders their Salvation, ſhould be called good fellowſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such friendſhip as is got and maintained by drinking at Taverns, and tipling at Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, is wofull friendſhip, for it makes God an enemy to us, and makes us enemies to God. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God, whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</hi> This is a weighty, dreadfull ſentence, and of large extent; It is better to have all the great men, yea all creatures our enemies,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105608:44"/>than to have God our enemy, yet it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that whoſoever will be the friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though this hath a ſhew of love and friendſhip, to go to the ale-houſe among our neighbours, and to ſit and tipple with them yet in reality there is more of hatred than love in it. To ſuffer ſin upon our neighbour, and not to reprove him is to hate him in our hearts. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> If they hate their neighbours in their hearts that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to live in ſin, and do not rebuke him, how much more do they hate them that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encourage their drunken meetings, by their preſence and example.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Suppoſe that going to the Ale-houſe with your neighbours, and to tipple there with them, were the way to preſerve love and friendſhip, yet we muſt not do any evil that good may come of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. <hi>And not rather as we be ſlanderouſly reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay; Let us do evil that good may come, whoſe damnation is juſt.</hi> This paſſage whoſe damnation is juſt, may either relate to the ſlanders that were raiſed of the Apoſtle's Perſon and Doctrine, and then the ſenſe is this, it will be a juſt thing with God to damn thoſe men that raiſe or ſpread abroad ſlanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of his Miniſters, either as to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Doctrine, for they do a world of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105608:45"/>and hinder the efficacy of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry by filling mens minds with prejudice againſt them; Or it may relate to the words immediately foregoing. <hi>Let us do evil that good may come.</hi> And the ſenſe is, that is juſt with God to damn thoſe men, who are of this opinion and practice: To do evil that good may come. A good intention will not excuſe, will not juſtifie a bad action in the ſight of God, for he will condemn evil doers, and that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: though they do evil that good may come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Tipling and drinking at ale-houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets quarrels and contentions, inſtead of friends, and makes thoſe that were friends before, oft times to become enemies one to another; for it often happens that when men are in their cups, on ſome trifling occaſion or other, they give provoking ſpeeches each to other, whence ariſe Law-ſuits, which prove very chargeable, vexatious, and of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; And ſometimes their quarrels are ſo great that they beat and wound each other, and ſometimes kill each other. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29, 30. <hi>Who hath ſorrow? who hath contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who hath wounds without cauſe— They that tarry long at the wine—</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 4. If I were a common, or an old drunkard, I ſhould look upon my ſelf to be in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105608:45"/>a wofull and miſerable condition, but though I confeſs I am ſometime overcome with wine and ſtrong drink, yet it is but lately that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun this practice, and I uſe it very ſeldom, when I light into company of my old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or at a fair, or at ſome other chance time, and therefore I hope my crime is not ſo great but I may be excuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The oftner a man commits any ſin, the more provoking his ſins are in the ſight of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.40. <hi>How oft did they provoke him in the Wilderneſs, and grieve him in the deſart?</hi> The frequency of the murmurings, and other ſins of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, did greatly greive the Lord, and provoke him to anger. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.1, 12. <hi>Ephraim dayly encreaſeth lies,— Ephraim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to anger moſt bitterly—</hi> To tell lies dayly, or to commit any other heinous ſin day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, provokes the Lord to anger moſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it be a great aggravation of drunkenneſs to be a common drunkard, and to be dayly tipling at ale-houſes, yet 'tis a vain thing for a man to think to excuſe himſelf by ſaying he is drunk but now and then, which he may be convinced of, if he ſee how vain this excuſe is in other ſins. If a Murderer ſhould ſay, I do not make it my common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to kill men, I do it but now and then, when I meet with men to whom I have born a grudge a long time; Or an adulterer ſhould
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105608:46"/>ſay, I do not commit adultery every day, it is but now and than, when I have convenient opportunity. Or a Thief ſhould ſay, I am no high-way man that maketh a trade of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, I do ſteal only at ſome times, when I can do it, and no body take notice of it: would not theſe excuſes be vain in the caſe of murder, adultery, theft, and ſuch like ſins? and if ſo, why not in the caſe of drunkenneſs alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſtians ſhould be ſo carefull of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſins as not to commit them ſo much as once. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Fornication, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs or covetouſneſs, let it not be once named among you, as becometh Saints.</hi> And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerning drunkenneſs, our Lord Jeſus chargeth us to beware not only of being drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en often, but leaſt at any time our hearts are overcharged with drunkenneſs. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>And take heed leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Once being drunk is enough to ſhut a man out of the Kingdom of Heaven for ever, without Repentance. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, revellings— they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> It is not ſaid, they that do ſuch things often— but they that do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. <hi>Adam</hi> did eat but once of the forbidden fruit, and for that one offence he was caſt out of Paradiſe, and by that one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence judgment came upon himſelf, and upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105608:46"/>all men to condemnation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. The <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> looked but once into the Ark, and for that one offence there dyed Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Threeſcore and Ten men. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. <hi>David</hi> numbered the people but once, yet for that one offence there came a Peſtilence, which killed Seventy Thouſand men. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. to the 16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though you are but beginning to be a company keeper, and are overcome but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet who knows that if at any time your heart be over-charged with drunkenneſs, but that may be the time when God may call you out of the World. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with drunkenneſs— and ſo that day come upon you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.</hi> God cuts off ſome men when they do but begin to be company keepers, and gives them their portion in eternal miſery. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.48, 49, 50, 51. <hi>If that evil Servant ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, the Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth..</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Though at preſent you are drunk but ſeldom, yet unleſs you repent, and break off this evil courſe of drinking, you will by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees fall into it more and more, and may in a little time prove as common, as notorious,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105608:47"/>as ſottiſh a drunkard as any other man; For it is ordinary for impenitent ſinners to grow more vile every day than other. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. <hi>Privacy in the commiſſion of this ſin is no excuſe for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 5. If I were an open drunkard I ſhould think my ſelf to be in a ſad condition, but though I cannot deny but that I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time overtaken with the ſin of drunkenneſs, yet it is very privately, and therefore I hope God will be mercifull to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The more open and impudent men are in the commiſſion of their ſins, the greater their puniſhment ſhall be. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth witneſs againſt them, and they declare their ſin as Sodom, they hide it not, wo unto their Soul—</hi> Thoſe impudent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as are not aſhamed to ſin openly, and ſeek not to hide their ſins, are in a moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Drunkenneſs is ſuch a ſhamefull ſin that in old times, men ſought for private times, and private places for the commiſſion of this ſin. They were aſhamed to be drunk in the day time, and took the opportunity of the dark night to keep their drunken meetings. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They that be drunken be drunken in the night.</hi> When ſome perſons that heard
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105608:47"/>the Apoſtles ſpeaking with tongues, ſuppoſed them to be drunk, the Apoſtle refutes that ſuppoſition, not from the piety of the men, that abhorred that vice, not from the rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their diſcourſe, but from the time of the day. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Theſe are not drunken as ye ſuppoſe, ſeeing it is but the third hour of the day.</hi> It was ſuch an unuſual thing in thoſe times, to ſee a man drunk in the day, that the Apoſtle thought it ſufficient proof that they were not drunken, becauſe it was but the third hour of the day. But alas, it is otherwiſe in theſe times, wherein we ſee men frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reeling and ſtaggering at high noon day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although open drunkards are in a worſe condition than ſuch as are ſecretly given to drunkenneſs, yet ſuch as are ſecret drunkards ſhall not be excuſed by their ſecreſie in their ſins. For,

                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 7. If I drink too much it is at ſuch times as I am urged and importuned thereto, by the company among whom I am, and I can't tell how to withſtand the importunity of my friends, when they are very urgent with me to drink beyond meaſure. I hope the urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and importunity of friends will be my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if I now and then drink too much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The great God is more urgent and importunate with you to abſtain from exceſſive drinking, and all other ſins, then any men can be. He calls to you, he chargeth you to take heed that you be not at any time overcharged with drunkenneſs. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfitting and drunkenneſs.</hi> He commands you to abſtain from drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105608:49"/>
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine.</hi> He beſeecheth you to abſtain from fleſhly luſts. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims abſtain from fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, which war againſt the Soul;</hi> And drunkenneſs is a luſt and work of the fleſh, as you may ſee. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. He pleads with you to turn from thoſe evil courſes that will be your ruine. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And ſhall not the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the great God prevail with you, above the importunity of all the men in the World; Though they be great men, though near friends, though ſuch as will be angry with you, if you yield not to them, yet their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhould not prevail with you to break the command of the great God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Brute beaſts cannot be drawn by any ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and importunity to drink more than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth their natures, unleſs there be force uſed with them, and the drink be powred down their throats, they will not take more than quencheth their thirſt; And therefore it is below a man to ſay, I could not avoid drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exceſs, for I was importuned and urged thereunto. Yea, they are ſunk a degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low beaſts, that will be prevailed with by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to drink more than is for their good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a man ſhould urge you to caſt your ſelves into a fiery furnace, would you conſent thereto, or if a man ſhould importune you to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105608:49"/>part with a fair Eſtate for a trifle, would you conſent to it? Should importunity prevail with you to do theſe things? When by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of any man you yield to drink unto drunkenneſs, you yield to that which is more prejudicial to you than caſting your ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fiery Furnace, or parting with a great eſtate for a trifle; For by drunkenneſs you provoke God to ſhut you out of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to caſt you body and ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, there to remain for ever; And that is infinitely worſe than to be caſt into any fiery Furnace on earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are none of your friends that urge and importune you to drink more than is for your good. They may be pretended friends, but are real enemies— For they urge you to that which will be your ruine, to that which will undo you Body and Soul for ever; And is he a friend or an enemy that urgeth you to that which will be your ruine.</p>

My Friends and Relations on whom I have my dependence are addicted to this ſin of drunkenneſs, and if I ſhould not do as they do, they would caſt me off, they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit me, they would leave me out of their Wills, and give me nothing at their death, and therefore I am forced to comply with their

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. You have a greater dependance on God than on any man upon the face of the Earth. You depend upon God for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, your life, your motion, yea, for all things. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live, and move and have our beings.</hi> And therefore you had need be more carefull to pleaſe, and more fearfull to offend God, than to pleaſe or offend any man on the face of the earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe your Parents or Relations ſhould caſt you off for retaining your integrity, and becauſe you will not defile your ſelf with their evil ways: the Lord will be a friend to you, and will take the care of you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10. <hi>When my Father and Mother forſake me, then the Lord will take me up.</hi> But if we ſin againſt God to pleaſe our Relations, and forſake his wayes, the Lord will caſt us off. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>If thou forſake him he will cast thee off for ever.</hi> And if the Lord caſt us off, it is not all the men in the World can do us good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is the loſs of an earthly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the loſs of the Kingdom of Heaven? Suppoſe you ſhould loſe a great inheritance on earth, for want of complying with your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Relations in ſinfull courſes, yet that is nothing in compariſon of the loſs of Heaven, which you will bring upon your ſelves by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive drinking, although it be to pleaſe your

If you ſuſtain loſs for Righteouſneſs ſake, all ſuch loſſes ſhall be made up with an hundred ſold advantage, both here and hereafter. <hi>Math.</hi> 19.29.

               <p n="4">4. If you reſolve to pleaſe God rather than to pleaſe your Friends: it may be the Lord will turn the hearts of your Friends towards you; For the hearts of all men are in his hands; And it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>When a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> And if God can encline the hearts of our enemies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, then much more the hearts of our friends, when we do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight; However run the hazard, rather adventure the diſpleaſing your friends by obeying God, than diſpleaſe God by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the ſinfull humours and ways of your friends.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. This is a vain, frivolous, fooliſh excuſe. If a thief ſhould ſay I never rob a man but when I meet with a rich and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prize. Or an adulterer ſhould ſay I never commit adultery but when I meet with a fair and beautifull woman. Would ſuch pleas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the thief and adulterer? No more will

               <p n="2">2. There is no purer, clearer, pleaſanter water, than Spring water, yet the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and purity of the Spring water doth not tempt the wild aſſes, or other beaſts, to drink more than will quench their thirſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.10, 11. <hi>He ſendeth the ſprings into the valleys, which run among the hills, they give drink to every beaſt of the field, the wild aſſes quench their thirſt.</hi> And ſhall man who was made after the Image of God, and who hath a more excellent Spirit than any of the beaſts, drink to exceſs, becauſe he meets with pure wine and excellent drink?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The pureſt and moſt excellent wine, when drunk to exceſs will prove the moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon, for it deſtroyes Body and Soul, whereas other poyſon deſtroys the Body only.

Or would drink the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and richeſt wine under Heaven, if he knew there were the poyſon of dragons, or the cruel venom of aſps infuſed into it? The guilt of drunkenneſs is more deſtructive to a man than the poyſon of dragons, or the cruel ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of aſps, for the one kills the Body only,

What the Lord tells us in his holy word, is as certainly true as what we ſee with our bodily eyes, and therefore ſeeing the Lord tells us that ſuch as are enticed by the pleaſantneſs of the look or taſt of the wine that is before them, to drink to exceſs, ſhall find their exceſs in drinking will bite them like a ſerpent, and ſting like an adder, this ſhould make us refrain immoderate drinking, although we ſhould meet with pure and pleaſant wine.

               <p>A. 1. Wine-biblers, ſuch as ſit drinking and tipling at Taverns and Ale-houſes, are an hatefull Generation of men, whoſe company and practiſes are to be ſhunned by ſober men. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Be not amongſt wine-biblers</hi>— Wine-biblers and Tavern haunters are ranked amongſt drunkards, as well as thoſe ſorts that drink till they reel, and are drunkards in the account of the Scriptures. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.21, 22. <hi>Be not amongſt wine-biblers, amongſt riotous eaters of fleſh, for the drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty. Solomon</hi> gives this reaſon why we ſhould not be among wine biblers, <hi>for the drunkard ſhall come to poverty,</hi> which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105608:53"/>plainly ſhews that a wine-bibber is eſteemed a drunkard. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ranks drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and drinkers of wine together. <hi>Joel</hi> 1.5. <hi>Awake ye drunkards, and weep, and howl all ye drinkers of wine.</hi> By drinkers of wine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not ſuch as drink wine for their health ſake with moderation, but out of wantonneſs, meerly to gratifie their ſenſual luſts, theſe may be ranked with drunkards, although they do not drink to ſuch a degree as to be dead drunk, or to be like bruits without underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a wo denounced againſt ſuch as tarry long at the wine, as well as againſt thoſe that are overcome with wine, and againſt ſuch as are haunters of Taverns. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29, 30. <hi>Who hath wo? — They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine.</hi> By ſuch as go to ſeek mixt wine, the <hi>Caldee</hi> paraphraſt underſtandeth ſuch as frequent Taverns and Ale-houſes. <hi>Iis qui vadunt &amp; inveſtigant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mixtionis, id eſt, popinam &amp; vini taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi> And therefore let not ſuch as are haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Ale-houſes and Taverns, eſpecially ſuch as tarry long there, think that they ſhall eſcape the judgments of God, becauſe they do not drink ſo much as they are not able to go without reeling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may be inflamed with wine and ſtrong drink, his body may be inflamed with a praeternatural heat, and his luſts may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with his exceſſive drinking, and yet a man may retain the uſe of his reaſon. Now
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105608:54"/>there is a wo denounced againſt ſuch as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue drinking wine, till wine enflame them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Wo unto them that riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow ſtrong drink, and continue till night, till wine enflame them.</hi> They that follow ſtrong drink, that is, haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Taverns and Ale-houſes, and ſuch as continue drinking and tipling till wine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them, have a wo denounced againſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is ſaid of <hi>Benhadad</hi> that he was drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf drunk, and yet he had not wholly loſt the uſe of his reaſon, for he was able to give inſtructions to his Commanders, and could ſpeak very good ſenſe, and was able to ride his horſe, and to flee from his enemies to ſave his life. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.16, 17, 18, 20. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad was drinking himſelf drunk,— And they told him there are men come out of Samaria, and he ſaid, whether they be come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they be come out for war, take them alive; And Benhadad the King of Syria eſcaped on an horſe with the horſe-men.</hi> Some men that are great drinkers will not be convinced that they are guilty of drunkenneſs, becauſe when they come from Taverns, they can ſpeak good ſenſe, they can give inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the carrying on of their Callings, they can eſcape the dangers that occur to them as they go home. But did not <hi>Behadad</hi> do as much as theſe things? Did not he give inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Commanders, what to do with

               <p n="5">5. There is a wo to them that are ſtrong to drink wine and ſtrong drink. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wo to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink.</hi> By ſuch as are mighty to drink wine, underſtand ſuch as can drink a large quantity of wine, and yet not be overcome with it, but can bear it away without ſtaggering, or loſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and this uſually comes to paſs through a long habit of drinking, and the longer men have been addicted to this ſin, and the ſtronger they are to bear wine, the more wofull their condition is.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To be full of wine, and to be drunken, ſignifie the ſame thing in Scripture Language. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. <hi>Others mocking ſaid, theſe men are full of new wine; But Peter ſaid unto them—Theſe men are not drunken, as ye ſuppoſe.</hi> When ſome mocked the Apoſtles, and ſaid they are full of new wine, their meaning was they were drunken, as <hi>Peter's</hi> anſwer to their calumny implyes; Theſe are not drunken as ye ſuppoſe. When a man doth frequent Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and when he is there, fills himſelf with wine or ſtrong drink, though he do not loſe his underſtanding, becauſe he hath a ſtronger
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105608:55"/>brain than other men, yet he is in Scripture accounted a drunkard, as well as thoſe ſottiſh perſons that drink till they are not able to ſpeak ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſin of drunkenneſs lyeth more in the inordinacy of the affection to wine and ſtrong drink, and in the exceſſive uſe of ſtrong drinks, than in the loſs of the underſtanding, which follows upon exceſſive drinking; For the loſs of the underſtanding hath more of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment than of ſin. It is a peculiar puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Lord hath annexed to this ſin, that he for a ſeaſon deprives men of the uſe of their reaſon and underſtanding; The depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the underſtanding as inflicted by God is paenal, as contracted by man through his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary drinking it is ſinfull.

                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 11. The world is now at that paſs, that a man can hardly make a good bargain, but he muſt go to a Tavern or Ale-houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can conclude it, and beſides trading is ſo bad, that if a new Cuſtomer come, or a former Cuſtomer lay out a conſiderable ſum of mony: to engage him to come again, I muſt go with him to the Tavern, and give him a glaſs of wine, and when I am among my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, or driving on a bargain, I forget my ſelf, and am ſurprized before I am aware, and I hope this will excuſe me.</p>
               <p>A. 1. It is an evil cuſtom, and ſinfull prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of many men to leave their Shops and Houſes to make bargains at Ale-houſes and Taverns. But ſuch as profeſs themſelves to be the ſervants of Chriſt muſt not conform to the ſinfull cuſtoms and practices of the men of this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this World.</hi> They muſt break and reform, and not follow evil cuſtoms.</p>

<list>
                     <item>(1.) You will loſe your reputation among ſober perſons, and that is a greater loſs to loſe your good name, than to loſe great riches. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.1. <hi>A good name is rather to be choſen than great riches.</hi> If a man be counted a tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a haunter of Taverns, this is a blemiſh
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105608:56"/>to him, he hath loſt his good name.</item>
                     <item>(2.) By driving bargains at Ale-houſes, you will be in danger to debauch your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and will loſe the peace of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, you will get a wound and a ſnare to your Soul. And if a man loſe a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is a greater loſs than the loſs of all Riches.</item>
                     <item>(3.) If you contract a habit of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by driving bargains at Ale-houſes, you will lofe your Souls, and the loſs of the Soul is ſuch a great loſs as can't be made up by the gaining of the whole World. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. <hi>For what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul.</hi>

                     <item>(4.) If you get a habit of drunkenneſs by frequenting Taverns, you will loſe the favour of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity.</hi> And a man had better loſe eſtate, liberty, life, and all that he hath in the World, than loſe the favour of God.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You do, and get more hurt than you are aware of, by frequenting Taverns to make bargains; For your example in frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taverns to make bargains encourageth others to go thither, who go out of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hardens them in their evil practice. And you get much hurt, for by degrees your heart will be hardened, and from ſipping now and then, you will proceed to larger draughts, and from thence to drunkenneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a far better way to engage Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105608:56"/>than to go to taverns with him, and that is, by affable carriage, by ſelling them good Commodities, by dealing juſtly and truly with them, this would invite men to deal with you. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.26. <hi>Every man ſhall kiſs his lips that giveth a right anſwer.</hi> When a man is known and proved to be a man of his word this doth ſo engage men to him that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one deſireth to deal with ſuch a man. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.20. <hi>A faithfull man ſhall abound with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</hi> Diligence in a mans Calling that alſo engageth Cuſtomers; All men love to employ a diligent perſon. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Seest thou a man diligent in his buſineſs, he ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings, he ſhall not stand before mean men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When your neceſſary occaſions draw you to a Tavern or Ale-houſe, look upon it as a place of temptation, and haſten away, be as one that ſitteth on thorns, be at no eaſe till you are gotten away.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It will not excuſe your drunkenneſs, to ſay I was ſurprized before I was aware, whilſt I was drinking with a Friend or a Cuſtomer, for you ought to watch over your ſelves, and it argues want of Wiſdom, to be deceived or ſurprized with wine or ſtrong drink. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.1. <hi>Wine is a mocker, and ſtrong drink is raging, whoſoever is deceived thereby is not wiſe.</hi>

               <p>§. <hi>The plea of ſuch as think drunkenneſs is no ſin, becauſe they have no trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, neither meet with any affliction for their exceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 12. If drunkenneſs were ſuch a great ſin as you would perſwade us, ſurely I ſhould have terrors in my Conſcience, or be followed with ſome ſore judgment for this ſin, but I have no terrors in my Conſcience, and I meet with no afflictions or judgments from God, and therefore I can't believe that drunkenneſs is ſuch an heinous and wofull ſin as you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. A man may be a greater ſinner in the ſight of God, and yet the Lord may not ſet home his ſin upon his Conſcience, or inflict his judgments upon him in this life, becauſe he reſerveth him to be puniſhed at the day of Judgment. <hi>Job.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Yet he layeth not folly to their charge. Job</hi> ſpeaks here of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſinners, that oppreſs the poor and needy, and fatherleſs, and take away their lands and flocks, and their rayment, and their food, inſomuch that they cauſe men to groan and cry out like wounded men, yet God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not folly to their charge, that is, doth not charge their ſin upon their Conſciences, nor puniſh them for their ſins. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptations, and to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgment, to be puniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is probable that you had ſome gripes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105608:57"/>in your Conſciences for this ſin, your hearts have ſmitten you at one time or another, though now you have by your ſottiſh courſes ſtifled thoſe checks of your Conſciences, and your Conſciences be now fallen aſleep; And it is very likely you have had many rebukes from God ſince you went on in this way, but you not regarded them. It is uſual with thoſe that are addicted to this ſin, to be regardleſs of God's dealings, both what God doth to themſelves and others. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5, 11, 12. — <hi>They follow ſtrong drink—they regard not the work of the Lord, nor conſider the Operation of his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If you have no remorſe of Conſcience for this ſin, this doth not argue your ſin to be a ſmall ſin, but ſhews that you are an obdurate hardned ſinner, and ſo your condition is much worſe than thoſe drunkards that have trouble of Conſcience for what they have done. They are the worſt ſort of ſinners, that ſin at an high rate, and yet feel no trouble in their minds for what they have done. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling have given themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> It is a wofull condition to be given up to an hard heart, and feared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to have no feeling of the evil of ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe you have met with no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God for your evil courſes, you have known or heard of others on whom God
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105608:58"/>hath ſent his judgments for their ſin of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, ſome have broken their limbs, ſome have broken their necks, others have had ther ſore judgments inflicted on them, all which are warnings to you and others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of, and forſake this ſin of drunkenneſs. If ſome drunkards be cut of in the act of ſin, while you are ſpared, you muſt not think that they were greater ſinners than you are, but by their example God calls you to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.4, 5. <hi>Thoſe eighteen upon whom the Tower of Siloam fell, and ſlew them, think ye that they were ſinners above all that dwell in Jeruſalem, I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Your proſpering in a ſinfull courſe, and being free from trouble of Conſcience, and alſo your being free from the judgments of God, is a ſure token that God intends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you for ever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.7. <hi>When the wicked ſpring as the graſs, and all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for ever.</hi> Some mens ſins go before to judgment, and ſome men they follow after. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. The leſs you meet with here for your ſins, the more you have to come in the other World.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you be free from God's judgments on your outward man, yet it may be he ſends his plagues upon your heart. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.14. <hi>I will at this time ſend all my plagues upon thine heart.</hi> If the Lord give a man up to his own
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105608:58"/>hearts luſts, or to an hard and impenitent heart, this is a worſe judgment than afflictions on the Body or Eſtate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 13. I would leave off this ſin of drunkenneſs were it not that I feared reproach and ſcorn, my companions with whom I have uſed to frequent Taverns and Ale-houſes will call me a preciſe fool, and ſay I am turned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, if I ſhould not do as they do, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my occaſions do oft times lead me into the company of Gentlemen that are great drinkers, and if I ſhould ſcruple drinking in their company, they would reproach and ſcorn me, now I ſtand much upon my honour, and to avoid reproaches, <hi>I</hi> am drawn to that which <hi>I</hi> am convinced is a great evil, but <hi>I</hi> can't avoid it unleſs <hi>I</hi> ſhould make my ſelf a deriſion and ſcorn among my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. If you ſtand upon your honour, then whatever ſcoffs are put upon you, hold faſt your Sobriety, be not by any means drawn to exceſſive drinking, for drunkenneſs is a great reproach to any man, be he a great or a mean man. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Sin is a reproach to any people.</hi> To be reproached for our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, or any other branch of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a real honour. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye, for the Spirit of Glory and of God reſteth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105608:59"/>upon you.</hi> Then we are reproached for the name of Chriſt, when we are reproached for our obedience to any of the Commandments of Chriſt, of which this is one. <hi>Take heed to your own ſelves, leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfitting and drunkenneſs— Luk.</hi> 21.34. And therefore if any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you, becauſe you will not overcharge your ſelves with drunkenneſs, this is your happineſs, this is your glory, for the Spirit of glory reſts upon thoſe that are reproached for the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None but fools will mock at you for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to drink to exceſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Fools make a mock at ſin.</hi> And who will regard what fools ſay? As for all good men, if you live in the fear of God they will honour you. It is mentioned as a Character of a good man, <hi>He honoureth them that fear the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 15.4. Yea if you abſtain from drunkenneſs out of Conſcience to the command of Chriſt, the Lord himſelf will honour you. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If you are aſhamed to keep your ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tp, becauſe of the ſcoffs and jears of ſottiſh men, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will diſown you, and be aſhamed of you before the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and before his Heavenly Father. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.33. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this ſinfull and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105608:59"/>man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If you will not turn from your ſottiſh courſes at the call and command of God, the Lord himſelf will laugh at you, and mock you in the day of your calamity. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23, 24, 26. <hi>Turn ye at my reproof — Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed — I alſo will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi> And that is very dreadfull, to have God inſtead of helping us in our diſtreſs, mock and laugh at us in our calamity. Yea the Devils alſo, who tempted you to ſin, will laugh at you in Hell for your folly, in parting with Heaven for ſuch a poor matter as a pot of drink.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You have ſlighty thoughts of ſin, and low thoughts of your immortal ſouls, and of the joys of Heaven, and the torments of Hell, if you will commit ſuch an horrible ſin as drunkenneſs, and caſt away your immortal ſouls, and deprive your ſelves of the joys of Heaven, rather than bear the ſcoffs and jears of fooliſh and ſottiſh men.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>The plea of rich men, whereby they would excuſe their drunkenneſs anſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 14. If <hi>I</hi> were a poor labouring man, and ſhould lye at the Ale-houſe, and ſpend what <hi>I</hi> earned, and my Family be in want, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be greatly to be blamed, but <hi>I</hi> am a rich man, and have a great Eſtate, <hi>I</hi> can ſpend freely at Taverns and Ale-houſes, and not feel any want of what <hi>I</hi> ſpend there, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105608:60"/>therefore <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> may be excuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is indeed a very great crime for labouring men, or any others, to waſt their Eſtates at Ale-houſes, whereby their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are brought to want. for ſuch are worſe than infidels. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denyed the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The rich drunkard ſhall find no more favour with God than the poor man, yea, than the begger; For the Lord is no reſpecter of perſons, but will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works. Riches avail nothing to keep off the wrath of God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath. Job</hi> 36.19. <hi>Will he eſteem thy riches? No not Gold, nor all the forces of ſtrength.</hi> Yea it will go worſe with rich drunkards at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than with poor men that have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to this ſin; For they ſin againſt greater mercy, and abuſe greater Talents than poor men, What is ſaid of the ruſt and canker, which is on the Gold and Silver of rich men that are covetous, and hoard up their Riches, and do no good with them. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Your Gold and your Silver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire, ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt day.</hi> The like may be ſaid of what rich men ſpend laviſhly at Taverns and Ale-houſes, your Gold and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105608:60"/>your Silver, which you have conſumed in a laviſh manner upon your luſts, will be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire, for at the laſt day you muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God for all that treaſure which you have waſted upon your luſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Rich men are not Lords of their Eſtates, to ſpend them according to their own will, they are but Stewards, and muſt emyloy them according to the will of God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo Miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> Though the Lord makes Rich his Stewards, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a propriety in all things that he commits to their truſt. He calls our corn and wine his corn and his wine, and our wool and flax, his wool and his flax. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I will take away my corn— and my wine— and my wool, and my flax given to cover her nakedneſs.</hi> All our cattel are his cattel. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Every beaſt of the forreſt is mine, and the cattel upon a thouſand hills.</hi> Yea the Lord hath a propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in all things, that all men have in all parts of the World. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. <hi>All that is in Heaven, and all that is in the Earth is thine.</hi> Now ſeeing rich men are but the Lord's Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, they muſt not ſpend their Eſtates upon their luſts, but muſt honour the Lord with them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance.</hi> What is ſpent in exceſs of wine and ſtrong drink, and riotous courſes, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105608:61"/>to the diſhonour of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What abundance of treaſure might you have laid up in Heaven, if you had given all that money to the poor members of Chriſt, which you have ſpent vainly and ſinfully at Taverns and Ale-houſes; Whereas all that is ſpent that way is treaſure laid up in Hell, that will torment you to Eternity.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>The plea of ſuch as go to Ale-houſes out of idleneſs, anſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 15. I go to Ale-houſes and Taverns only at ſuch times as I have nothing elſe to do, and I have found the pot and the pipe, and a merry companion, delightfull paſtimes, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it is pleaſant recreation to ſit in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and to hear and tell news, and talk of old ſtories over a pot of drink, or a diſh of Coffee, ſhould I not do this, I ſhould be at a loſs how to ſpend away my time, my ſpare hours would be a burden to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Thoſe men do not know the worth and preciouſneſs of time, that go to Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, Ale-houſes and Taverns, meerly out of an idle humour, to paſs away the time. Time is more precious than Silver and Gold, for all the Silver and Gold in the World can't purchaſe one day, one hour of that time which is paſt, and hath been miſpent—Upon this moment of time well improved or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent, dependeth our eternal happineſs, or eternal miſery. It is a great ſin for a man to ſpend his mony idly and vainly, but it is a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105608:61"/>greater ſin to ſpend his time which is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Money, in a vain and idle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you do not know how to prize your time, conſider the dolefull lamentations of deſpairing ſouls, that think the day of Grace is paſt, and liſten to the ſighs and groans of dying men, who have not made their peace with God, and whoſe Conſciences are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their miſpent time. And conſider what precious thoughts damned ſouls have of time? Oh what would dying men, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouls give for ſo much time to repent, and make their peace with God, as you ſpend idly in ale-houſes and taverns? They would give Millions of Silver and Gold, yea the whole World, to gain but ſo much time as you miſpend in idleneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To idle away precious time in coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and ale-houſes, which is the common practiſe of many perſons, is a great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſin, and I ſhall give one inſtance for the proof hereof. Idleneſs was one of the ſins for which God deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> with Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49, 50. <hi>Behold this was the iniquity of thy Siſter Sodom; Pride, fullneſs of bread, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of idleneſs was in her, and in her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters— Therefore I took them away as I ſaw good.</hi> Now that is an horrible ſin which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to rain down Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, upon ſuch a famous City as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:105608:62"/>and conſume it with all its inhabitants to aſhes. And if idleneſs were ſuch a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſin in a <hi>Sodomite,</hi> then it is far worſe in a Chriſtian. Anidle Chriſtian is worſe thau an idle <hi>Sodomite,</hi> for Chriſtianity teacheth us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than the light of nature taught the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> It ſhall be more tolerable at the day of judgment for the men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> than for ſuch as profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, and yet ſpend their time in idleneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as are Chriſtians indeed, and live in the exerciſe of the power of Godlineſs, have ſo much work to do for God, and for their own ſouls, and for others, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complain of want of time, than want of paſtimes and recreations.

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is true that wine and ſtrong drink moderately taken, are uſefull for ſuch as are of a ſorrowfull ſpirit, for they are of a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>Wine that maketh glad the heart of man.</hi>— and are to be given chiefly to ſuch as are of a ſorrowfull ſpirit. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.6, 7. <hi>Give ſtrong drink unto him that is ready to periſh, and wine unto thoſe that be of an heavy heart. Let him drink and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his poverty, and remember his ſorrow no more.</hi> But this doth not give a liberty to any perſon to drink wine or ſtrong drink to exceſs. And if you make uſe of time to chear your hearts, why not at your own houſes rather than ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wine and ſtrong drink taken immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately inſtead of driving away ſorrows bring much wo and ſorrow. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29, 30. <hi>Who hath wo?

                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 17. I am a young man, and young men muſt have their paſtimes and recreations, and this is that which pleaſeth me above other delights, to keep jovial company, and to be merry with my companions at a Tavern, and I hope this is allowable in a young man, and if it be not, I have time enough before me, I will repent when I am old, and then God will be gracious unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Drunkenneſs is an abominable ſin in any men, either young or old, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be allowed, not to be pleaded for in any. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity</hi>— This will not exempt a man from the hatred of God, that he is a young man,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105608:64"/>if he be a worker of iniquity; For all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of evil doers are hatefull to God, the young as well as the old.

Vain and loſe young men, that give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their pleaſures, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the advice and counſel of Parents, Friends, Relations, or God's Miniſters, they may if they think good take their own courſe, and do whatever their own hearts prompt them to, and is pleaſing to their corrupt natures, but yet let them know that the Lord will call them to judgment for all their idle courſes, and ſinfull pleaſures, and miſpent time. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know thou that for all theſe things, God will call thee to judgment.</hi>
               </p>

                     <item>(2.) It is dangerous to ſpend your young time in riotous courſes, or other ſins, and think to repent when you are old, becauſe you do not know whether you ſhall live to be old, God cuts off ſome perſons that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to company keeping, when they do but begin to follow after vain perſons, and to eat and drink with the drunken. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.48.49, 50, 51. <hi>If that evil ſervant ſhall begin to ſmite his ſellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, the Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</hi>

If I were a prophane drunkard, that would curſe and ſwear, I ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf as in a very ſad condition; but though I am now and then overcome with drink, I am a Religious perſon, I hear and write Sermons, I pray in my Family, I will lay down my life for Chriſt, I will rather burn than turn from the true Religion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope God will not take any notice of my ſin, though I do ſometimes drink to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To be a drunkard, and yet to be a Religious perſon are inconſiſtent each with other, as inconſiſtent as light and darkneſs, as Heaven and Hell. The grace of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man to live ſoberly. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105608:66"/>appeared to all men, teaching us the denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent World.</hi> And therefore ſuch as live intemperately, and have not learned ſobriety, are deſtitute of the grace of God. That man that maketh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, and yet is a drunkard, his Religion is a vain Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our making a profeſſion of Religion, and performing Holy duties, will be ſo far from cauſing God to take no notice of our ſins, that he will viſit us ſooner, and puniſh us more ſeverely than other men, if we live in drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, or ſuch like ſins. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> Such of the <hi>Jews</hi> as made a profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet lived ſinfull lives, the Lord tells them he would puniſh them for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, even for all of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The prayers, and other Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of drunkards are an abomination to God. <hi>Prov,</hi> 15.8. <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> Sacrifice was part of God's worſhip under the Law, and when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up in a right manner was very acceptable to God, yet when performed by a wicked man, it was an abomination to the Lord. The ſervices of impenitent ſinners are a burden and a wearineſs to the Lord. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Incenſe is an abomination to me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, and calling of Aſſemblies, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105608:66"/>away with, it is iniquity, even the ſolemn meeting, your new moons, and your appointed feasts my Soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.</hi> Incenſe did caſt forth a ſweet and delightful ſmell, yet when offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by impenitent ſinner it was an abomination to the Lord If impenitent ſinners ſhould have ſuch gifts in prayer, as that their prayers ſhould be pleaſing and delightfull to thoſe that joyn with them, yet their prayers are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as make a profeſſion of Religion, and yet live in drunkenneſs, are worſe, and in a more woful condition than ignorant and prophane drunkards. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. <hi>Wo to the drunkards of Ephraim. Ephraim</hi> was a Tribe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a drunken <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is in a more wofull condition than a drunken <hi>Egyptian,</hi> or a drunken <hi>Philiſtine.</hi>— The ſins of ſuch as make a profeſſion of Religion, do bring more diſhonour to God, and ſcandal to Religion, then the ſins of other men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 23, 24. <hi>Behold thou art called a Jew, and reſteſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God— Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, through break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law diſhonoureſt thou God; For the name of God is blaſphemed through you, among the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They deceive their own hearts, that think they could lay down their lives for Chriſt, who will not, who cannot lay down a ſwiniſh and ſottiſh luſt for Chriſt, which is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

I live in a drunken ſottiſh place, where my neighbours are generally given to drinking, and if I ſhould not do as my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours do, I ſhall be envied and hated, and they will put troubleſome offices upon me, or raiſe me in the rates, or do me ſome ill turn, and therefore though I approve not of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tipling, yet I am neceſſitated to do as they do, elſe <hi>I</hi> ſhould not live a quiet life amongſt them. <hi>I</hi> do this only to avoid trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> may be excuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. If you will not live ſoberly, and temperately, and righteouſly in this preſent evil world for fear of hatred and envy, and trouble, then it is not poſſible that you ſhould be a true Chriſtian, and lead a holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous life, or do any good works, for no man can be a Chriſtian indeed, but wicked men will hate him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake.</hi> No man can lead a Godly Life, but he ſhall meet with trouble. 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 3.12. <hi>Yea, and all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> No man can do any good work but ſome or other will envy him. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I conſidered all navel, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.</hi>

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:105608:67"/>
               <p n="2">2. If you live righteouſly and ſoberly God will love you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.8. <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous.</hi> But if you be a worker of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the Lord will hate you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi> And if the Lord love you, you need not be troubled though all your neighbours, and all the men in the World hate you. And if the Lord hate you, it is not the love of your neighbours will comfort you under the hatred of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you be hated of your Neighbours, and have ill Offices done you, becauſe you will not break the Commandments of God, as other men do, this is matter of joy rather than of ſorrow, ſuch hatred makes you happy rather than miſerable. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.22, 23. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye when men ſhall hate you, and when they ſhall ſeparate you from their company, and ſhall reproach you, and caſt out your name as evil, for the Son of Mans ſake. Rejoyce ye in that day. and leap for joy, for behold great is your reward in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is far better being troubled and hated, and envyed of men, raiſed in your rates, and to have all the ill Offices done that you can think of, than to have troubles in your own Conſciences, and be ſhut out of Heaven, and be tormented in Hell for ever, which will be the certain effect and conſequence of drunkenneſs.

If you cannot withſtand the temptation of drunkenneſs, by reaſon of your living among ſottiſh neighbours, remove your habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and chooſe a dwelling among more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and pious perſons, whoſe Godly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may excite and encourage you to lead a Godly Life.</p>

If I thought God would ſhut me out of Heaven for exceſſive drinking, I would forthwith leave off my going to Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and Taverns, and would never be drunk any more, for I am not ſuch a fool, as to caſt away my immortal Soul, and deprive my ſelf of the glory and joys of Heaven for ever, for ſo ſmall a matter as wine or ſtrong drink, but it can't enter into my heart to believe that God will ſhut men out of Heaven, and caſt them into Hell, for ſuch a ſmall ſin as drunkenneſs, for ſuch a ſmall matter as drinking a little too much wine or ſtrong drink, and therefore I will take my liberty to eat and drink, and be merry, and hope to go to Heaven as well as the moſt preciſe, and abſtemious perſons in the World</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Doſt thou call drunkenneſs a ſmall ſin? It is a great, abominable, a monſtrous, moſt loathſome and beaſtly ſin. It is a ſin
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105608:68"/>againſt the light of nature, and a ſin againſt the light of Scripture. It makes a man like a beaſt yea worſe than a beaſt, for there are many beaſts will not drink more than ſatisfieth nature. It makes a man like a devil, ſome men when they are in their cups will rage and ſwear, and curſe at that dreadfull rate, that they ſeem rather to be incarnate devils than men. Yea ſome drunka ds are worſe than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, for the devils are afraid of being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and pray that they may not be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented before their time. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Noah</hi> was once overtaken with Drunkenneſs, and <hi>Lot</hi> was ſurprized twice, yet they were no Drunkards. A Drunkard is one that is addicted and given to the ſin of drunkenneſs, one that is frequently overcome with VVine and ſtrong drink.

A Sheep may fall into the Mire, but they are Swine that love to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the mire.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is true all men have their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and failings whilſt they are in this World. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon Earth that doth good and ſinneth not.</hi> The holieſt men in the world have acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be imperfect.

Yet <hi>Job</hi> was conſcious to himſelf of his infirmities, and durſt not ſtand upon his own juſtification in the ſight
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105608:74"/>of God and ſay that he was perfect. <hi>Job.</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelf, my own Mouth ſhall condemn me, if I ſay I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth himſelf imperfect. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> But although the Servants of God have their infirmities, they do not live in ſuch beaſtly ſins as Drunkenneſs. What <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of the degenerate <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 32.5. may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Drunkards. <hi>They have corrupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are a perverſe and a crooked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> They flatter and delude themſelves, who live in ſuch vicious courſes as drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and call their ſins their infirmities.</p>

But this is not the caſe of drunkards, they do not uſe means to avoid drunkenneſs, they may keep at home, and not go to taverns and alehouſes, and when they are there, they may forbear drinking, and ſeeing they do not uſe means to ſhun this ſin, as avoid going to Taverns, and avoid ſuch company as draws them to this ſin, their ſin of drunkenneſs is not an infirmity, but a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſin.</item>

When God commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that they ſhould not go up againſt the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and yet they would go contrary to the command of God, they are charged with rebellion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinning againſt God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.42, 43. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto me, ſay unto them, go not up, neither fight— So I ſpake unto you, and ye would not hear, but rebelled againſt the Commandment of the Lord, and went preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly up into the Hill.</hi> The caſe is the ſame with drunkards, they are rebels againſt God, and preſumptuous ſinners; The Lord ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; <hi>Be not drunk with wine — Eph.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, leaſt at any time

But they will not hear, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt the command of God, and go on preſumptuouſly, and will drink wine and ſtrong drink till they are drunk, they are ſo far from taking heed leaſt any time their hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with drunkenneſs, that they are oft times overcharged with this ſin. When God commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to caſt away the Idols of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they would not hearken to him, this is called rebelling againſt God. <hi>Ezek</hi> 20.7, 8. <hi>Then ſaid I, caſt ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not your ſelves with the Idols of Egypt, I am the Lord your God; But they rebelled againſt me, and would not hearken unto me, they did not every man caſt away the abominations of their eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they forſake the Idols of Egypt.</hi> The caſe is the ſame here, God commands every one to leave off the ſin of drunkenneſs, but when men will not hearken to the Lord, but will be drunk ſtill, this is rebellion againſt God.</item>
                  <item>3. When men plot and contrive how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their ſins, they do not ſin by ſurprize, but with deliberation, this is preſumptuous ſinning againſt God.

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Deſpair doth harden mens hearts to go on ſtill in their treſpaſſes. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. <hi>And they ſaid, There is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the Imagination of his own evil heart.</hi> And therefore we ſhould be careful that we do not give way to deſpairing thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mercy of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though your caſe ſhould be hopeleſs, yet you had better break of your evil courſes, than go on to add ſin to ſin, for that will leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen your torments in the other world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is hope upon your Repentance, that you may obtain mercy from God, though you have been as vile a Drunkard as any that lives upon the face of the Earth, For 1. The blood of Chriſt is of ſufficient vertue to waſh away the greateſt ſins of the greateſt ſinners in the world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> All ſins though never ſo many for number, and never ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous for nature are cleanſed away by the blood of Chriſt, from ſuch as repent and believe in him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> 2. The Lord for Chriſt his ſake hath promiſed remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins upon their repentance to the chiefeſt of ſinners, and ſuch as have continued ſo long
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105608:83"/>in their ſins, that they have even wearied the patience of God to bear with them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well—Come now let us reaſon together, though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> The moſt heinous ſins, ſuch as are like ſcarlet and crimſon of a deep die, ſhall be forgiven to ſuch as ceaſe to do evil. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.24, 25. <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy ſins.</hi> Though a man hath been a very wicked man, and led an evil Life, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted abundance of ſin, yet upon his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, God will pardon all his ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> 3. Abominable Drunkards, and other vile ſinners have obtained pardon of ſin through the blood of Chriſt, and Sanctification by the Spirit of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Such were ſome of you, that is, ſuch as are mentioned in the foregoing verſes, <hi>Drunkards, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Adulterers, abuſers of themſelves with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105608:84"/>Mankind, Theives, Revilers, Extortioners.</hi> And yet though ſome of them had been ſuch abominable ſinners, they were pardoned by the blood, and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt. And therefore let no man though a great ſinner, though the chiefeſt of ſinners, ſay his caſe is deſperate, for there is mercy for him upon his Repentance. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Who ſo confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and forſaketh ſhall have mercy.</hi>

               <p>If drunkenneſs be ſuch a wofull ſin, then let me exhort all perſons that are addicted to this ſin of drunkenneſs, whether they be rich or poor, young or old, ſpeedily to break of their ſin, and to leave of their drunken courſes and companions. I entreat, and beſeech you for God's ſake, whoſe name is diſhonoured by this beaſtly ſin, and for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, who ſhed his moſt precious blood to redeem you from this and your other ſins, and for the Holy Ghoſt's ſake, who is greived and vexed by your ſenſual courſes, and for the Goſpel's ſake, which is ſcandalized by your loſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and for your own ſake, that you would not ruine your ſelves Body and Soul for ever, and for the Kingdom of Heaven's ſake, that you would not deprive your ſelves of the unſpeakable glory and joys of Heaven, rather than to leave off this ſwiniſh ſin, and for your Families that you would not ruine and corrupt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105608:84"/>your Families, and entail God's Judgments on your Poſterity, and for the Nation's ſake, that you would not pull down God's wrath upon the Land of your Nativity, leave off your drunkenneſs and company-keeping. If you have any regard to the honour of God, if you have any love to Jeſus Chriſt, if you have any reſpect to the Bleſſed Spirit of God, if you have any reſpect to your own welfare, either in this or the World to come, if you have any love to your Families, or to the Nation in which you live, break off this beaſtly, this ſottiſh, this bewitching, this abominable, this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſin of drunkenneſs. To preſs on this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation the more effectually, conſider,
<list>
                     <item>1. If you will turn from this loathſome ſin of drunkenneſs, there will be exceeding great joy both in Heaven and Earth at your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Your Parents, and Godly Relations, that have prayed for you, and wept for your diſorderly courſes, they will rejoyce at your Converſion. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.1. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father.</hi> The Miniſters of God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce exceedingly at your Converſion, for they have no greater joy in this World, than to ſee the fruit of their labours in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Holy Converſation and Salvation of thoſe to whom they preach. <hi>Joh. 3d. Epiſt.</hi> 3.4. <hi>I rejoyced greatly when the brethren came and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the truth; I haveno greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</hi> The Apoſtle
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105608:85"/>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuch joy in the Converſion of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that he was not able to expreſs his joy, and his thankfulneſs to God for their Converſion. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.9. <hi>What thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy, wherewith we joy for your ſakes before our God.</hi> And the Saints and Servants of God will joy to hear of your Converſion. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.3. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Converſion of the Gentiles— they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great joy unto all the brethren.</hi> Yea more if you repent of your ſins, and turn from drunkenneſs, you will cauſe joy among all the Angels of Heaven. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7, 10.</item>
                     <item>2. If you neglect or refuſe to break off this ſin of drunkenneſs, you will be grief to God and Men, and bring grief and ſorrow to your own Soul. You will grieve God that made you, and maintains you, that God in whom you live, and move, and have your being. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great on the Earth— And it grieved him at his heart.</hi> And by your hardneſs of heart, and perſiſting ſtill in your ſins, you will grieve Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhed his blood to ſave loſt man. <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. —<hi>Being grieved for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearts.</hi> Your going on in this ſin in a rebellious manner will grieve the Holy Spirit of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.</hi> You will be a grief to your Parents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.13. <hi>A fooliſh ſon is the calamity of his Father.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105608:85"/>to her that bare him.</hi> You will be a great grief to God's Miniſters, and to all Godly People. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136, 158. <hi>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.

               </p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more to perſwade you to leave off this vile ſin of drunkenneſs? If teares would prevail with you, I would ſay with the Prophet, Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a Fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night before you, till I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with you to leave this abominable, this Soul deſtroying ſin of drunkenneſs. If the mercies of God would make any impreſſion upon your hearts, I would beſeech you by all the mercies of God, that ever you received, or hope to receive, either in this World, or in the World to come, to break off this beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin. If God's promiſes would do any thing to lead you to Repentance, I might tell you what great things God hath promiſed to do for you, if you will leave of this, and your other ſins; He will give you a free, full and eternal
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105608:86"/>pardon of all your Tranſgreſſions, he will give you his Heavenly Kingdom, where you ſhall have unſpeakable glory, fullneſs of joy, and Rivers of pleaſure for evermore, he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no good thing from you. If you have any fear of God's judgments, I might tell you of the VVorm that dyeth not, of the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of darkneſs, of being ſent from Chriſt's Judgment Seat, with a curſe into Everlaſting Fire, to have your abode with the Devil and his Angels, all which things, and more than the tongue of man can expreſs, will be your portion, if you break not off this damnable ſin of drunkenneſs. If any words or arguments will prevail with you, I could wiſh I had the tongue of Men and Angels, to ſpeak to you in the moſt perſwaſive manner, to leave off this Soul deſtroying ſin.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>The convinced ſinner's caſe conſidered, that is almoſt perſwaded to leave off this ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be ſome will ſay, my heart begins to relent, methinks I am almoſt perſwaded to leave off my drunkenneſs, and to become a new man, I am of the mind to bind my ſelf with a vow, and to make a ſolemn promiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be drunk any more, what counſel would you give to one in my condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Do not only almoſt, but altogether reſolve to leave off this ſin, elſe you will be but almoſt ſaved. If you be double minded, ſometimes of the mind to leave your ſins, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105608:86"/>ſometimes of the mind to keep them ſtill, you will be unſtable in all your wayes. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not only reſolve, and promiſe, and vow to forſake this ſin, but perform your vows and promiſes; As that man's Son dealt with his Father, whom his Father bid go and work in his Vineyard, he ſaid <hi>I go Sir, but he went not. Matth.</hi> 21.30. So many men deal with God, they make promiſes to God to leave their ſins, but they perform them not. Now it is better not to make any vows or promiſes of Reformation, than after we have made them, not to perform them. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is that thou ſhouldſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of leaving this ſin for a time, and then returning to it again, as the dog doth to his vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire, for the latter end of ſuch perſons is worſe than the beginning. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Turn from all your other ſins as well as drunkenneſs, if you would find favour with God, and obtain the remiſſion of your ſins. It is not ſufficient to caſt away ſome of our ſins, but if we would eſcape Eternal Death, we muſt caſt them all away, and not allow our ſelves in any known ſin. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your Tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new Spirit, for why will ye dye O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:105608:87"/>
               <p>§. <hi>The lingring ſinner's plea anſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am convinced I muſt leave off my drunken courſes, or elſe there is no Salvation for me, and I am purpoſed to do ſo, but I am deſirous to have a few merry bouts more at drinking, and then I will become a new man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Sinful luſts are inſatiable, it is not once or twice gratifying our ſinful luſts that will give ſatisfaction to our corrupt natures, but the oftner we fulfil the luſts and deſires of the fleſh, the more ſtrongly our hearts will be carried out after ſin. It is here as it is with the fire, the laying on new fewel makes the fire rage and burn more furiouſly, the adding of new acts of ſin, makes our luſts to rage and crave the more furiouſly for farther opportunities of ſin. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.28, 29. As Idolaters and Adulterers are inſatiable in their luſts, ſo are drunkards, and other ſinners alſo. The ſluggard, the longer he lyeth in his bed, the lother he is to riſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.9, 10. So it is with the drunkard, the longer he lyeth in his drunkenneſs, the more unwilling he will be to leave it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The time paſt is ſufficient, and too much which you have already ſpent in ſin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. and therefore you ſhould not waſt any more precious time in ſuch ſottiſh courſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thy own heart, and the Devil deceive thee, in ſuggeſting ſuch thoughts as theſe, <hi>I</hi> will have but a merry bout or two more in drinking, and then <hi>I</hi> will leave this courſe; For it is likely thou haſt thought and reſolved
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105608:87"/>ſo many times heretofore, and yet nothing is done. When a Sermon hath come home to thy Conſcience, or when thou haſt been near unto death, or haſt met with ſome ſtartling providence, haſt thou not thought with thy ſelf, I will leave of my drunkenneſs, and what ſet a time for thy Repentance, and yet thou art fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to it a freſh again. Sin is of a deceitful hardning nature, if it can but prevail with us to defer our Repentance, it will harden our hearts. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. VVho can tell but the next merry bout which thou haſt with thy companions, thou may'ſt be taken out of the VVorld. VVhile <hi>Job</hi>'s children were eating and drinking wine in their Eldeſt Brother's houſe, they were all ſlain by a great wind that blew down the houſe, <hi>Job</hi> 1.18, 19. VVhy may not ſudden death come upon thee when thou art drinking wine, and making merry, as well as on <hi>Job</hi>'s chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They were the children of a Godly man, their mirth was innocent mirth, yet were they cut off while they were drinking wine; And why may it not be ſo with thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? The Rich man that ſaid to his Soul, eat drink, be merry, had his ſoul taken from him that very night. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19, 20.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>The preſumptuous ſinner's Plea anſwered, who goes on in his ſin, preſuming that at what time ſoever he repents God will be merciful to him, and preſuming that he may live long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſay, God is a merciful and gracious
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105608:88"/>God, and at what time ſoever a ſinner repents of his ſins, God will pardon him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will repent of my evil wayes, but not yet, I will enjoy my ſinful delights a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and then I will repent, and I doubt not but God will be merciful to me, and that I ſhall go to Heaven as well as other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is an horrible abuſe of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to take occaſion from God's mercy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin. Gods goodneſs ſhould lead us to Repentance, and therefore they that preſume upon God's mercy, to continue and go on in their ſins, are guilty of deſpiſing the riches of God's grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true that God hath promiſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give penitent ſinners at what time ſoever they repent truly of their ſins, but he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give Repentance to ſuch as refuſe to turn at his call, and go on in their ſins, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that God will be gracious to them. True Repentance is never too late, but late Repentance is ſeldom true.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though you be young and ſtrong, and like to live many years, yet it is dangerous to defer your Repentance on many accounts, as 1. Life is uncertain, ſome die in their full ſtrength, and the height of their proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when they are at greateſt eaſe, they go down in a moment into the grave. <hi>Job.</hi> 21.13, 23. Such as promiſe themſelves many years in this VVorld, may not have one days continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19, 20. And if ſudden Death take you away before you have repented of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105608:88"/>your ſin, you are loſt for ever. 2. If your life ſhould be continued, God may take away the uſe of your underſtanding, and give you up to diſtraction, and perſons under diſtraction are not apprehenſive, what need they have of Repentance. 3. If you ſhould enjoy Life, and have the uſe of your underſtanding, yet who can tell whither God will give you repentance for your ſin, it may be he will give you up to your hearts luſts, inſtead of giving you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and becauſe you refuſed to repent in the day that he offer'd you mercy, poſſibly he may ſwear in his VVrath, that you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into his reſt, as he did to the <hi>Jews, Heb.</hi> 3.7, 8, 11. 4. If you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, it may be it will be as <hi>Judas</hi> did repent, he grew deſperate, and hanged himſelf, he was ſo burdned and troubled in his Conſcience for his ſin, that he could not bear his burden, but went away and hung himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.3, 5. <hi>Judas repented himſelf, ſaying I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and went and hanged himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let ſuch as put off their repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are young and ſtrong, and like to live many years, or on any other account, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, that if they do not repent now, it is moſt likely they will not repent, nor leave off their ſins as long as they live. For, 1. The longer you live in ſin, the leſs able you will be to repent, for continuance in ſin ſtrengthens ſin, and weakens the Soul. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. Cuſtom in ſin doth give ſin ſuch rooting in the heart,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105608:89"/>that it will be as hard a matter for ſuch as have got a cuſtom of ſinning to leave their ſins, as it will be for a Blackamore to change his skin, or the Leopard his Spots. 2. The longer any man lives in his ſins, the leſs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he will be to repent, for his inclinations to ſin will be ſtrong, and his averſneſs to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs greater, and his heart will be more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſin. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. 3. The longer a man continueth to provoke God, the leſs hope there is of his aſſiſtance, and giving us his grace, and the more ground for fear, that he ſhould ſay his Spirit ſhall no more ſtrive with us. 4. The World and the Fleſh and the Devil will be as tempting hereafter as they are now, and our hearts as ready, and more ready to yield than they are now.</p>
               <p>§. <hi>The plea of ſuch as ſay they would leave off their drunkenneſs, but they cannot. Helps againſt this ſin of drunkenneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſay, I am abundantly convinced that Drunkenneſs is an abominable ſin, and I would leave it, but I cannot, I find it hath got ſuch power over me as that I can't withſtand it, What ſhall I do, that I may be able to leave this ſin?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> It is no eaſie matter for a man that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this ſin to leave it, it is of ſuch an enticing bewitching nature, and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet out the greatneſs of this ſin, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Pleas that are made uſe of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this ſin, I ſhall now propoſe ſome helps againſt this ſin.</p>

The VVoman of <hi>Samaria</hi> that diſcourſed with Chriſt at <hi>Jacob</hi>'s VVell, was a great ſinner; ſhe lived with a man that was not her Husband, and ſo was an Adultreſs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105608:91"/>the greateſt ignorance and blindneſs, he can make thoſe that have carnal and vile hearts to become Heavenly and Spiritual. He can make the chief of ſinners to become the greateſt Saints. There is a poſſibility, yea, a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that God may give repentance to ſuch as are the greateſt Slaves to Sin and Satan, that Satan leads them Captive at his pleaſure, and doth with them, even what he will, and oppoſe the means of their recovery; yet ſuch as theſe may be recovered out of the Devil's ſnare. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. <hi>In meekneſs inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will give them Repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Lay to heart and believe the truth of thoſe things which the Scriptures ſpeak concerning drunkards and drunkenneſs. As namely, that drunkenneſs is a manifeſt work of the fleſh, concerning which the Lord tells again and again, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20.21. It will as certainly exclude a man out of Heaven as Murder and Adultery, or any other ſin. We are told plainly in God's word, that drunkards ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Drunkards ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And that Hell is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for drunkards, and doth as it were open its mouth to receive them, and that ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after ſtrong drink, and enflame themſelves with wine, though there be multitudes of them, and ſome of them very jolly men, and live in great pomp and ſplendor, their pomp and their multitude, and their glory, ſhall deſcend into Hell. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 14. The Scriptures tell us plainly, that ſuch as drink till they are drunken, the Lord will cut them aſunder, and give them their portion with unbelievers. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.45, 46. And where ſhall unbelievers have their portion? In Hell fire. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> So that it is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105608:94"/>evident from the Scriptures, that drunkards ſhall moſt certainly be ſhut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and be caſt into Hell fire; For nothing is more certainly true than what God hath revealed in the Scriptures; And therefore let me reaſon a little with all thoſe drunkards, into whoſe hands this diſcourſe ſhall come, about the certainty of their damnation, if they perſiſt in their drunken and ſottiſh courſes.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe all the Miniſters that are this day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, and all the knowing and wiſe men in the World, ſhould come to thee, and tell thee if thou doſt not leave off thy drunkenneſs, thou wilt certainly be ſhut out of Heaven, and be caſt into Hell, would this ſtartle thee? That which the Lord tells us in his Holy Word, is more certainly true than what is told us by all the men of the world: For all men are fallible and ſubject to miſtakes, and may be overtaken with a lye, but God is infallible, and is a God that cannot lye. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe one of thy drunken companions that dyed in his ſins, and is now in Hell, ſhould be permitted to come from the dead, and ſhould tell thee, Hell fire is an intolerable torment, for I have been in it, and I am ſent by God to thee, to tell thee except thou doſt repent of thy ſins, and leave of thy drunkenneſs, thou ſhalt as certainly go to Hell as I, or any other ſinner, would this make thee leave thy ſin? Or ſuppoſe one of thy Godly Friends or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105608:95"/>that is now in Heaven, ſhould come to thee from Heaven and ſay, I am ſent from God to tell thee, that except thou doſt repent and leave off thy drunkenneſs, thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be caſt into Hell; would this ſtartle thee? wouldſt thou believe this Meſſage, would this make thee repent: God's word is more to be credited, and a more forcible means to perſwade men to repent, than a meſſage brought by a Saint or Sinner riſen from the dead. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.30, 31. <hi>If one went from the dead, they will repent; And he ſaid unto him, if they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi>

Or ſuppoſe an Angel ſhould bring thee a Liſt of the names of thoſe that ſhall be condemned at the day of judgment, would this ſtartle thee to ſee thy name in that Liſt? When the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells thee that no drunkard ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God, but they ſhall all without Repentance be caſt into Hell-fire, that is more certain, than if thou heardeſt a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, telling thee thou art a damned creature, or then if thou ſaweſt thy name in the Liſt of thoſe that are to be damned, for there is as great, or a greater certainty in what we read in the Scriptures, than in what we hear ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105608:95"/>by a voice from Heaven. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.19. <hi>And this voice which came from Heaven we heard—We have alſo a more ſure word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Lord himſelf ſhould come and ſpeak to thee in a dream, as he did to <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech. Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and ſaid unto him, behold thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou haſt taken, for ſhe is a mans wife,</hi> Suppoſe I ſay, the Lord himſelf ſhould ſay to thee in a dream, or a viſion: Behold thou art a damned creature, for the evil courſes that thou takeſt, if thou doſt not break off thy drunkenneſs, I will caſt thee into Hell-fire; would not this make thee leave off thy drunkenneſs? The Lord tells thee in his Word, that drunkards ſhall not inherit his Kingdom, but ſhall be caſt into that Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone; And what God ſaith to thee in the Scriptures is as much to be regarded, is as true and certain as what he ſaith to us in a dream or viſion; or by an audible voice from Heaven.</p>
               <p>What the Scripture ſaith, God ſaith, for the Scriptures are God's Word, and therefore what the Scripiure ſaith ſhall be, is as certain to come to paſs as if it were already done. What the Scripture ſaith is more ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than what we ſee with our eyes, or hear with our eares, or feel with our hands, for our ſenſes are fallible. When <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s eyes were dim, he miſtook <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Eſau,</hi> though
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105608:96"/>he heard him ſpeak, and felt him with his hands, but what the Scripture ſaith is infallible — For all Scripture was given by inſpiration of God, and God is an infallible God. And therefore know O drunkard, whoſoever thou art that readeſt theſe lines, that if thou doſt not leave off thy drunkenneſs, thy damnation is more certain than any thing that thou ſeeſt with thy eyes, or heareſt with thy eares, or feeleſt with thy hands. Thou art as ſure to go into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, as if thou wert there already; Thou art as ſure to be ſhut out of Heaven, and caſt into Hell, as if thou heardeſt a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, telling thee thou art a damned creature.</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle ſaid to the <hi>Galathians. Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>O fooliſh Galathians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, Crucified among you;</hi> In like manner may I ſpeak to drunkards; Oh fooliſh drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who hath bewitched you that ye ſhould not obey the Commandment of God, who commands you to leave off your drunkenneſs, when as it is evidently ſet forth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that no drunkards ſhall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Surely drunkards either do not read the Scriptures, or if they do read them, they do not believe what they read, or if they believe the truth of the Scriptures, they ſlip out of their minds, and they do not lay them to heart, for if they did really believe that their drunkenneſs would ſhut them out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105608:96"/>and caſt them into Hell, they would break of this damnable ſin.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105608:97"/>There is ſo much evil and danger in being among drunkards, that ſober men that have any regard to the Commandments of God, and to their own wellfare, ſhould avoid as much as they can coming into their company. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20, 21. <hi>Be not amongſt Winebibbers—For the Drunkard ſhall come to poverty.</hi> Here are two things obſervable, 1.

As keeping company with angry and furious men, we ſhall learn their ways, and become furious like unto them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24, 25. <hi>Make no Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with an angry man, and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go, leſt thou learn his ways, and get a ſnare to thy Soul.</hi> So by keeping Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Drunkards, we are in danger to learn their ways, and to get a ſnare to our Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Avoid going to Ale-houſes and Taverns, if you would avoid drunkenneſs. For by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch Places you are under a temptation to ſin by exceſs of wine and ſtrong Drink. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> adviſeth thoſe that would ſhun the ſin of uncleanneſs, not to come near the door of an Harlots houſe, leſt being near her door, they ſhould be drawn to go into her houſe, and bring diſhonour to them by committing that ſhameful ſin of uncleanneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8, 9.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105608:97"/>
                  <hi>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her houſe, leſt thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel.</hi> The like a dvice may I give to ſuch as are inclined to the ſin of drunkenneſs. Keep from Taverns and Ale-houſes, come not near ſuch Places, leſt you be tempted by Satan and your own hearts, to go in and be overcome with VVine and ſtrong drink.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Avoid laying VVagers, or playing at Cards or Dice, or any ſuch like Games for VVine or ſtrong Drink, for this is an occaſion of much evil, and very frequently draws per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to drink unto unceſs.</p>

It was a wiſe Speech of a Lord Chancellour oft noted by Mr. <hi>Harris.</hi> I will pray for the Kings Health, and drink for my own.

               <p n="6">6. If you would not be overcome with wine or ſtrong drink, watch and pray againſt, and reſiſt the temptations that you meet with to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105608:98"/>this Sin. It is our bleſſed Saviour's counſel. <hi>Watch and Pray that you enter not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Matth.</hi> 26.41. And we had need watch and pray that we enter not into temptation, becauſe our corrupt natures are eaſily drawn to ſin when we meet with temptations to ſin. And therefore we had need watch and ſtrive, and reſiſt temptations, and beſides, our own endeavours to pray for God's Grace to aſſiſt us. I will inſtance in ſome times of temptation, wherein we had need be very watchful that we fall not into this ſin.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When we are at Feaſts, or in the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or in the Company of great perſons, where there is great plenty of Wine and ſtrong Drink, that a man may take his fill of free coſt and he is called upon to eat and drink abundantly, if a man be not very watchful and careful of himſelf at ſuch a time, he is in danger to fall into exceſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2. <hi>When thou ſitteſt to eat with a Ruler, conſider diligently what is before thee, and put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to thy appetite.</hi> Rulers Tables are furniſhed with variety of the choiceſt meats, and plenty of all ſorts of wine. <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.18. And therefore ſuch as eat with Rulers, ſhould conſider diligently what is before them, that is, they ſhould conſider, and that diligently what ſnares and temptations are before them, and what danger they are in to offend God by exceſs of eating and drinking, when they have ſuch variety and plenty before them of thoſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105608:98"/>things that may entice them to exceſs. And beſides that caution, <hi>conſider diligently what is before thee.</hi> There is another awakening expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Put a knife to thy Throat, if thou be a man given to thine appetite, that is, 1. Stand in as much awe, and be in as great fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God by thine exceſs in eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a man is in fear of offending that hath a knife put to his Throat 2. Look upon thy Soul to be in as great danger of periſhing by intemperance when thou art at a great man's table, as thy body is in danger of periſhing when thou haſt a knife at thy Throat. Or, 3. Put a knife to thy Throat, that is, uſe all means poſſible to mortifie and reſtrain thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate appetite, 'tis like the expreſſion, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I will keep my Mouth with a bridle.</hi> that is, I will force my ſelf to be ſilent, I will refrain from ſpeaking, I will keep in ſuch words as are unſeemly, though they would be breaking out. So put a knife to thy Throat, that is, reſtrain thine inordinate affections, force thy ſelf to be temperate in eating and drinking. Many think that it is a deſirable thing to be invited to feaſts with great men, to eat at a Rulers Table, and they have a longing mind after ſuch things, but let them hear what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in this caſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Be not deſirous of his dainties, for they are deceitful meat.</hi> The greater dainties are on the Table, the greater is the danger. The Daintier our Meat and Drink is, the more deceitful. For
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105608:99"/>while dainties pleaſe the Palate, if they allure us to intemperance, they kill the Soul. And is not that deceitful, that comes with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of pleaſure, and deſtroys both Body and Soul.</item>
                  <item>2. You are under a temptation to this ſin, when ſenſual Luſts ariſe in your hearts, or evil motions are put into your minds by Satan, whereby you are enticed and enclined to go to Taverns and Ale-houſes, to be merry among your jovial Companions. <hi>James.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his luſt, and enticed.</hi> Now when ſuch Luſts or inordinate deſires after wine or ſtrong drink ariſe in your hearts, do not gratifie them, do not make any proviſion for their ſatisfaction. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Make no proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> But withſtand, reſiſt, and deny their ſolicitations, hearken not to their enticings, but liſt your heart to God to ſubdue your evil inclinations, and attend the the works of your callings. When the luſts of our hearts ſolicit us to evil, we may give a double reply to them, <hi>Non licet.</hi> How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God. And <hi>Non vacat.</hi> I am not at leiſure. We may reply as <hi>Nehemiah, Neh.</hi> 6.3. When we are employed and diligent in our callings, we have a great advantage againſt the luſts of our own heart, and the temptations of Satan by not being at leiſure to attend their motions. When we are idle, and out of employment,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105608:99"/>our own ſins, and Satans temptations have a great advantage on us, and will eaſily prevail over us.</item>
                  <item>3. You are under a temptation to this ſin, when your drunken companions entice and call you to go to the Alehouſe, or when being there they urge and importune you to drink more than is meet. In this caſe remember what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10, 15, 18. <hi>My Son if ſinners entice thee conſent not— my ſon walk not thou in the way with them, refrain thy foot from their path. They lay wait for their own blood, they lurk privily for their own lives.</hi> If one ſhould entice you to an Alehouſe, to murder you when he comes there, if you knew this before hand, would you go with him. They that entice you to Alehouſes, and make you drunk when you come there, do a worſe thing than murder your Bodies, for they draw you to that ſin which will damn your Body and Soul for ever, and that is a worſe hurt than murder. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of ſuch as yield to the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of an Harlot. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>With much fair ſpeech ſhe cauſed him to yield.— He goeth after her ſtrait-way, as an Ox goeth to the ſlaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the ſtocks, till a Dart ſtriketh through his Liver, as a bird haſteth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is for his Life.</hi> The ſame is applicable to thoſe that yield to the enticing of drunkards, or other ſins. VVhen they yield to their enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, and go along with them, they go as an
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105608:100"/>Ox to the ſlaughter, that they follow them to their own deſtruction, as ſurely, though they conſider it as little, as the Ox that goeth to the ſlaughter; they go as a Fool to the correction of the ſtocks, when once they are got in, they can as hardly get out, as a man can get his feet out of the Stocks. Till a dart ſtrike through his Liver; that is, till he be certainly ruined, body, and Soul. If a dart go through the Arm or Thigh, that wound may be cured, but if it ſtrike through the Liver, it is certain death, there is no cure for ſuch a wound. As a bird haſteth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. A ſnare taketh ſuddenly, and holdeth ſurely. Such is the caſe of thoſe that follow the enticing of Sinners, they as little conſider that they are doing that which will deſtroy their Souls, that their lives lie at ſtake, as the bird doth that haſtneth to the ſnare, ſhe looks for meat, but looſeth her life, ſo doth the Drunkard that is taken in the ſnare of evil Company, he looketh for pleaſure, but looſeth his Soul.</item>
                  <item>4. You are under a temptation to exceſs of drinking, when you meet with brisk and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Wine, or other pleaſant drink, that which is pleaſant to the Eye, or pleaſant to the Taſt. The moſt pleaſing Wine, or other drink it taken exceſſively, will bite like a Serpent, and ſting like an Addar, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31, 32.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Let ſuch as would avoid drunkenneſs, mortifie their inordinate affection to Wine and ſtrong Drink. This is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inordinacy of the affections to VVine, or ſtrong Drink, is is ſinful and offenſive to God, as well as the act of Drunkenneſs. It is evil to have the mind and heart hanging after Taverns and Ale-houſes, as well as to be a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter of thoſe places. He is a Drunkard in his heart, that hath an inordinate Affection to Wine or ſtrong Drink, as well as he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Adultery with a Woman in his heart, that luſteth after her in his heart. Beſides this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affection to Wine or ſtrong Drink is the root of this ſin of drunkenneſs. We do not lay the Ax to the root of Drunkenneſs, if we only indeavour to forbear the actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of this ſin, and do not endeavour to mortifie our inordinate affections. A man may purpoſe, and make vows, and uſe other means to break off this ſin, but if there be in his heart an inordinate affection to VVine or ſtrong drink, he will not be able to leave off his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs. But here ſome may ſay,</p>
               <p>How ſhall we get our inordinate affections to wine and ſtrong drink mortifyed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1, Seek after Union with Jeſus Chriſt. It is through Union with Chriſt that we receive vertue from him for the crucifying of our ſinful Luſts, and inordinate affections, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105608:101"/>that are Chriſt's, have crucifyed the Fleſh with the affections and Luſts.</hi> The affections cleave ſo faſt to ſin, and are carried out ſo inordinately after the Creatures, that nothing leſs than Grace given to us from Jeſus Chriſt, can turn the heart from ſin, and place the affections on right objects. VVe may think our ſelves free, but we ſhall never be free indeed from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſin and inordinate affections, till Jeſus Chriſt makes us free. <hi>John.</hi> 8.36. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, then ſhall ye be free indeed.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Be convinced and perſwaded in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the great evil that is in ſetting your Affections inordinately on VVine, or ſtrong Drink, or any other Creature. VVhen man was in his ſtate of Innocency, his judgments ruled his affections, and when God recovers man out of his fallen Eſtate, he works upon and regulates his affections, by enlightning, and renewing the Mind. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge.</hi> Knowledge hath a great influence on renewing the Man, that is, all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul. Underſtand therefore, and be perſwaded in your Judgments and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that there is much evil in ſetting your affections inordinately on VVine and ſtrong Drink, or any other Creatures. I will inſtance in ſome of thoſe evils. 1. Such as love wine or ſtrong drink inordinately make not the Lord their God, but make <hi>Bacchus</hi> their God. VVhat a man loves moſt and beſt, that is his God. They that have ſuch a love for wine
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105608:101"/>and ſtrong drink, that they value not the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of the Command of God to take their fill of their drink, they love their drink more and better than they love God, and ſo make their drink their God. 2. Sinful Luſts, and inordinate affections tend to the Soul's ruine and deſtruction. They are the banes, the poyſon of our immortal Souls. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly Luſts which war againſt the Soul.</hi> By fleſhly luſts, underſtand all the evil deſires and inordinate affections of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And ſhall we cheriſh and imbrace that which is and will be the deſtruction of our Souls? 3. VVeigh well the evils and miſchiefs that ariſe from the love and following after ſtrong drink, and from exceſſive drinking, which are ſet down <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</item>
                  <item>3. The way to mortifie inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Earthly things, is to ſet our affections on things which be above, and to get a well-grounded hope of our enjoying the Glory and Pleaſures of the VVorld to come. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2, 4, 5. <hi>Set your affections on things above—When Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye appear with him in glory. Mortifie therefore your Members which are upon the Earth—inordinate affection.</hi> As it is in caſe of exceſſive bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by opening a Vein, the courſe of the blood is turned, and thereby immoderate bleeding at the Noſe is ſtayed. So here when our affections run out inordinately to Earthly things, the ſetting our affections on things
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105608:102"/>above, will turn the ſtream of our affections, that they will not as formerly run out after the world. VVe ſhall taſt ſuch ſweetneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things by ſetting our affections on them, that we ſhall not deſire the delights and vanities of the world; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs — When I remember thee on my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> found ſuch ſweetneſs and delight in God, that he had what he could deſire, he was ſatisfied, and did not deſire the delights and pleaſures of the world, he was abundantly pleaſed and ſatisfied in his enjoyment of God.</item>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We put on Chriſt by faith, when we put on a garment we apply it to our bodies, So we put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when we make application of him, and his ſaving benefits to our ſouls Chriſt is to be put on not only for juſtification from the guilt, but alſo for ſanctification from the filth and power of ſin. For he hath righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, merit and ſpirit for ſinners; wherein all that believe in him do communicate with him. This is abſolutely neceſſary for the mortification of this and all other ſins, the power of ſin can never be ſubdued but by the power of Chriſt. <hi>Our old man muſt be crucified with him,</hi> Rom. 6.6. and <hi>through the ſpirit we muſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deeds of the body, Rom.</hi> 8.13. To him therefore muſt we look, and upon him we muſt rely by faith for grace and help, to enable us to forſake and mortifie our ſins. It is through faith in Chriſt that we obtain victory over our corruption, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is the victory that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the world, even our faith.</hi> By the world which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by faith underſtand not onely th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> men of the world, but the luſts and corruptions which we are liable to, whileſt we are in the world. Now we have good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to look to Chriſt and rely on him for grace to help us againſt our luſts. For, 1. Jeſus Chriſt was ſent into the world by the Father on purpoſe to bleſs us in turning us from our iniquities, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. And we may warrantably rely on Chriſt for the giving us thoſe bleſſings which his Father ſent him to beſlow upon us. 2. Our Lord Jeſus gave himſelf to death for us that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the guilt and power of all our ſins, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works.</hi> And we may warrantably rely on Chriſt for that bleſſing, which he hath purchaſed for us with his own blood. 3. Truſting and hoping in Chriſt is the way to be redeemed from all our iniquities, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:105608:105"/>130.7, 8. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord — And he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We put on Chriſt by imitation, when we make him our pattern and example, reſolving and endeavouring by the help of his grace to walk as he walked while he was in the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. It was one end of God's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt into the world to ſet us an example even in our own humane nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.</hi> And it is our duty to be followers of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart, Joh.</hi> 13.15. <hi>I have given you an example that ye ſhould do as I have done,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Be ye followers of me even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi> Now Chriſt did no ſin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Christ alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that ye ſhould follow his steps; who did no ſin.</hi> The wicked Jewes indeed maliciouſly ſlandered him, and ſaid, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber.</hi> But they laid to his charge things that he knew not. And Chriſt challenged any of them to prove their charge. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.46. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi> If then we thus put on Jeſus Chriſt by imitation, and warrant our practiſe by his example, we ſhall not make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof which is the laſt direction.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord (in whoſe hand the hearts of all men are) turn the eyes of concerned ſinners upon theſe lines, convince the guilty of the evil, aggravations, and danger of this ſhameful, woful, deſtroying, damning yet abounding ſin, ſtop the mouth of all pleas in excuſe, or extenuation thereof; and effectually perſuade to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious compliance with the counſel of God by ſpeedy repentance, and thorow reformation, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-feel the dreadful execution of the wo denounced.</p>
